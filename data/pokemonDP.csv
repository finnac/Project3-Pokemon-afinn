13,33,257,ASH,And they're all feeling so sick. 
13,33,258,OLD LADY,Excuse me. 
13,33,259,OLD LADY,"Have a look at this! When I was a youngster, I would grind it up and use it as a poison antidote! "
13,33,260,BROCK,I know this. It's a Lava Cookie! It can neutralize the poison's effects! Thank you so much! 
13,33,261,OLD LADY,My pleasure! Just please help those poor Pokémon! 
13,33,262,BROCK,Right!

13,33,284,PICHU,[WEAK] 
13,33,285,BROCK,Oh no! I guess the medicine wasn't enough to neutralize Tentacruel's Poison after all! 
13,33,286,NORMAJEAN,"I'm so worried! Brock, what are we going to do? "
13,33,287,BROCK,I'm sorry. I'm afraid I just don't know.

13,33,292,NURSE JOY,"Pleasure to meet you, Brock. I was wondering if you were able to find anything effective against the poison. "
13,33,293,BROCK,"I was! But because we didn't have enough, they haven't fully recovered. Do you have any idea when you'll be arriving here? "
13,33,294,NURSE JOY,Not sure. I'm afraid it could be as long as two hours. 
13,33,295,BROCK,Pichu's in bad shape! Its fever's up and it's having trouble breathing! 
13,33,296,NURSE JOY,"Please, Brock, try to stay calm. Until we reach you, just do the best you can. "
13,33,297,BROCK,"But, Nurse Joy, I'm only a Pokémon Breeder. I honestly don't know what else to do. "
13,33,298,NURSE JOY,"Think, Brock! "
13,33,299,NURSE JOY,"The truth is, you're on your own until we get there! There's got to be something. Something else you can do for them. "

13,31,64,DAWN,Paul using Thunder that way. 
13,31,65,BARRY,"Just like before, when Infernape used Flare Blitz from underground. "
13,31,66,BROCK,I guess it's Paul's way of getting back at Ash for using the field to his advantage.

13,31,78,BARRY,I can't believe Gliscor's caught again! 
13,31,79,BROCK,Paul likes to take his opponent's att*cks and then wait for just the right moment to strike back. 
13,31,80,ASH,Gliscor! Get out of there! 
13,31,81,ANNOUNCER,"Although struggling mightily, Gliscor can't break loose! "

13,31,104,"DAWN, BARRY, PIPLUP",[SURPRISED] 
13,31,105,BROCK,"See, Electivire's special Ability is Motor Drive, so when it gets hit by an Electric-type att*ck, it takes no damage and its speed increases! "
13,31,106,BROCK,"If a powerful Pokémon like Electivire can boost its speed, it becomes a real thr*at! "
13,31,107,BARRY,Wait! Then Ash should avoid using Electric-type att*cks. 
13,31,108,DAWN,"You're right, Barry! Nice! "

13,31,132,REGGIE,Unless he's up to something. 
13,31,133,JESSIE,Poor Pikachu is stuck but good! 
13,31,134,JAMES,"A formidable sticky wicket, no doubt. "

13,31,159,BROCK,"Since they're both Electric-types, their Electric-type att*cks won't be very effective, which means the only moves they can use... "
13,31,160,BROCK,"...are Brick Break, Iron Tail... "

13,31,372,ASH,"Yeah! Sure has, Paul! Are you going? "
13,31,373,PAUL,"I lost, Ash, didn't I? So, there's no reason to stay. I'm going to go back to Snowpoint City and request another battle there with Brandon. "
13,31,374,ASH,"Gotcha. Good luck, Paul! "
13,31,375,PAUL,Yeah. Thanks. You too. 
13,31,376,CYNTHIA,"Paul and Ash. Someday soon they'll both be entering the Champion League, and how I look forward to that day! "
13,31,377,PAUL,So I'll see you. 
13,31,378,ASH,"One more thing, Paul! Let's battle again really soon! "
13,31,379,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
13,31,380,NARRATOR,"And so, with the Sinnoh League battle against his greatest rival behind him, Paul continues on toward his next challenge. "
13,31,381,NARRATOR,"And Ash, after his victory against Paul, prepares to move on to his next battle against Darkrai! "
13,31,382,NARRATOR,"Will the Sinnoh League fates allow our hero to taste victory again? The answer is coming soon, as the journey continues"
13,29,0,ANNOUNCER,"The first quarter-final Battle of the Sinnoh League tournament at Lily Of The Valley Island is about be waged on a dirt b*ttlefield, and now in a six-on-six Full Battle format! "
13,29,1,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
13,29,2,ANNOUNCER,"Representing Kanto is Ash from Pallet Town, facing off against Paul from Veilstone City, and the tension is formidable indeed! "
13,29,3,ANNOUNCER,And their first Pokémon are? 
13,29,4,ASH,"All right, ready Pikachu? "
13,29,5,PIKACHU,[READY] 
13,29,6,PAUL,"Aggron, stand by for battle! "
13,29,7,AGGRON,[APPEARING] 
13,29,8,PIPLUP,[IMPRESSED] 
13,29,9,POKEDEX,"Aggron. The Iron Armor Pokémon, and the evolved form of Lairon. Aggron claims a large mountain for its territory, and fiercely defends it from those who trespass. "
13,29,10,AGGRON,[CHALLENGING] 
13,29,11,NARRATOR,Ash and Paul are finally face to face in this first quarter-final Battle! 
13,29,12,NARRATOR,"And with everything they're sure to have learned since their Full Battle on the banks of Lake Acuity, you can be certain this will be the ultimate battle of rivals! It's about you It's about me It's about hope It's about dreams It's about friends that work together To claim their destiny It's about reaching for the skies Pokemon! Given the courage And willing to try It's about never giving up So hold your head up And we will carry on... Sinnoh League Victors Pokemon! "
13,29,13,GLISCOR,[SOARING] 
13,29,14,ASH,"Ready Gliscor? Now, use Giga Impact! "
13,29,15,GLISCOR,[GIGA IMPACT MOVE] 
13,29,16,BARRY,Awesome! Amazing! 
13,29,17,GLISCOR,[EXERTION] 
13,29,18,MAMOSWINE,[RESISTING] 
13,29,19,GLISCOR,[RETREATING] 
13,29,20,GLISCOR,[PROUD]  
13,29,21,ASH,"Way to go! Now make sure you don't forget that timing, okay? "
13,29,22,BARRY,That Giga Impact was the best! And landing that cool pose afterwards like that made it even better! 
13,29,23,BROCK,"Yeah, but still, there's a catch when you use Giga Impact. Gliscor's not able to move for a short while afterwards, but knowing that, Gliscor backed away quickly for easier defense! "
13,29,24,ASH,"Awesome, huh? Gliscor learned a lot from battling the Air Battle Master! Training with him was a really good thing for you, wasn't it? "
13,29,25,GLISCOR,[EXCITED] 
13,29,26,BARRY,"Oh man, oh man, I wish your quarter-final match against Paul were happening right now! I'll bet you already know which Pokémon you're going to use, right? "
13,29,27,ASH,"Barry, of course I do! I've given it a ton of thought, and I've got the whole thing figured out. "
13,29,28,ASH,"Man, does this remind me of Lake Acuity! Paul and his Pokémon were so strong... "
13,29,29,ASH,"So, ever since our Full Battle... I've been thinking about how Paul got that way! "
13,29,30,BARRY,So? How did he do it? 
13,29,31,ASH,Paul takes everything he's ever experienced and uses it to get stronger! 
13,29,32,BARRY,Yeah? Tell me something I don't know... 
13,29,33,BROCK,The point is it's a lot easier said than done! 
13,29,34,BARRY,"Okay, but turning experience into strength applies to you too, doesn't it? "
13,29,35,ASH,"Yeah, but it's gotten me thinking... If I'm wondering about everything Paul's been through to get stronger, then I need to look at what I've been through to get stronger as well! "
13,29,36,BARRY,"So, did you figure it out yet? "
13,29,37,ASH,"Hey, you'll see! Soon as I'm out there battling Paul! Right, Pikachu and Gliscor? "
13,29,38,PIKACHU,[AGREEING] 
13,29,39,GLISCOR,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,29,40,BARRY,"Ash, if you're going to keep me hanging like that I'm going to have to fine you big time! "
13,29,41,DAWN,There you go!  
13,29,42,PIPLUP,[PROUD] 
13,29,43,DAWN,"You look absolutely handsome in that outfit, Piplup! "
13,29,44,PIPLUP,[SMUG] 
13,29,45,DAWN,You're the best cheerleader ever! Let's go show everyone your outfit! 
13,29,46,PIPLUP,[PROUD] 
13,29,47,REGGIE,I wish I could be there... 
13,29,48,PAUL,I know that. You have work... 
13,29,49,REGGIE,"Right. So, tell me... have you given any thought to changing your Pokémon lineup? "
13,29,50,PAUL,I'm keeping it as is. 
13,29,51,REGGIE,I'm really happy for you. 
13,29,52,PAUL,For what? 
13,29,53,REGGIE,That you and Ash got to know each other! There's not another Trainer who's influenced you the way he does! 
13,29,54,REGGIE,I have one last thing to tell you... 
13,29,55,REGGIE,Paul... 
13,29,56,REGGIE,Win this! Don't underestimate Ash's skill! Then win the whole thing! 
13,29,57,PAUL,I will! 
13,29,58,REGGIE,"Later, Paul! "
13,29,59,DAWN,"That was Reggie you were talking to, so is he coming here today? "
13,29,60,PAUL,"So, how is he doing? "
13,29,61,DAWN,"Uh... You mean, how is Ash? "
13,29,62,PIPLUP,[CONFUSED] 
13,29,63,DAWN,"Wait! If you ask a question, don't you want to hear the answer? "
13,29,64,DAWN,Ash's doing some last-minute Training with his Pokémon. Want me to get him? 
13,29,65,PAUL,Please don't. No need... 
13,29,66,DAWN,Why did you ask about him then? 
13,29,67,PIPLUP,[CONFUSED] - 
13,29,68,PAUL,I don't know. - 
13,29,69,DAWN,"Oh, great! "
13,29,70,PAUL,I just don't like him... 
13,29,71,PIPLUP,[CONFUSED] 
13,29,72,PAUL,"He talks just like my brother. Friends, trust... My brother says those things all the time, too... "
13,29,73,DAWN,"But Paul, Ash isn't Reggie. Ash is Ash, and that's that! "
13,29,74,BARRY,Paul! 
13,29,75,ASH,Hey Dawn! Paul! 
13,29,76,PAUL,"Look, Ash is like any other Trainer I'd have to battle in the quarter-finals... "
13,29,77,PAUL,And I'm going to have to b*at him if I want to win the Sinnoh League! 
13,29,78,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
13,29,79,BARRY,"So, Dawn, I'll bet you were trying to find out which Pokémon Paul's going to use, right? "
13,29,80,DAWN,No. Wrong! 
13,29,81,PIPLUP,[ANNOYED] 
13,29,82,ASH,"Cynthia's going to be watching, Paul! Let's make it a great Battle! "
13,29,83,PIKACHU,[HAPPY] 
13,29,84,PAUL,I plan to... 
13,29,85,DAWN,"I remember ""When every life meets another life, something will be born..."" "
13,29,86,"ASH, PIKACHU",[SHOCK] 
13,29,87,BARRY,Hold on! I didn't know you were a poet. 
13,29,88,BROCK,It's a quote... from the Sinnoh Time Space Legend! And they're also the exact same words Cynthia used to describe Ash and Paul. 
13,29,89,DAWN,"All right, so when Ash meets Paul, let's see, or Paul meets Ash... something will be born... But, now I'm wondering what that ""something"" is. "
13,29,90,DAWN,Maybe we'll find out in today's Battle! 
13,29,91,PIPLUP,[HAPPY] 
13,29,92,BARRY,"I'm beginning to get really, really tired of you guys not filling me in and leaving me hanging all the time! I want to find that something too! "
13,29,93,PAUL,"Ash, I'll see you on the b*ttlefield. "
13,29,94,ASH,Right! 
13,29,95,PAUL,"Now, Aggron, go! Use Metal Claw! "
13,29,96,AGGRON,[METAL CLAW MOVE] 
13,29,97,ASH,"Pikachu, draw Aggron in with Iron Tail! "
13,29,98,PIKACHU,[IRON TAIL MOVE] 
13,29,99,AGGRON,[DEFENDING] 
13,29,100,ANNOUNCER,"And Pikachu's Iron Tail stops Aggron's Metal Claw, showing their strength to be about even! "
13,29,101,"PAUL, AGGRON",Use Metal Sound! 
13,29,102,PIKACHU,[STRUGGLING] 
13,29,103,ANNOUNCER,There's Metal Sound! And it's definitely having an effect on Pikachu! 
13,29,104,MEOWTH,Ow! 
13,29,105,MEOWTH,It's smacking my sensitive ears 
13,29,106,JESSIE,Concentrate on something really important like making money! 
13,29,107,JAMES,We've worked hard to sell here inside the inner Sinnoh League sanctum! 
13,29,108,"JESSIE, JAMES","And, of course we do it all for the Boss! "
13,29,109,PIPLUP,[PAINED] 
13,29,110,DAWN,"Piplup, are you okay? "
13,29,111,BROCK,"Metal Sound is a move that's used to lower your opponent's Special Defense! And if it's reaching all the way up here, it must be really powerful... "
13,29,112,PIKACHU,[PAINED] 
13,29,113,ASH,"All right, Pikachu, Thunderbolt, let's go! "
13,29,114,PIKACHU,[THUNDERBOLT MOVE] 
13,29,115,AGGRON,[PAINED] 
13,29,116,ASH,"Pikachu, now use Volt Tackle! "
13,29,117,PIKACHU,[VOLT TACKLE MOVE] 
13,29,118,PAUL,"Aggron, fl*sh Cannon! "
13,29,119,AGGRON,[fl*sh CANNON MOVE] 
13,29,120,PIKACHU,[PAINED] 
13,29,121,ASH,"Oh no, Pikachu! "
13,29,122,ANNOUNCER,That fl*sh Cannon stopped Volt Tackle cold! And it did a lot of damage... 
13,29,123,ASH,"All right, Pikachu, time out! "
13,29,124,PIKACHU,[AGREEING] 
13,29,125,ANNOUNCER,Pikachu gets switched out in the middle of some brave battling! 
13,29,126,ASH,"Pikachu, you were great!  "
13,29,127,PIKACHU,[THANKFUL] 
13,29,128,BARRY,That was close! For a second I thought Pikachu was unable to battle! 
13,29,129,PIPLUP,[FIERCE] 
13,29,130,BARRY,"It sure is impressive that Paul knows how to raise some powerful Pokémon, though! "
13,29,131,DAWN,It must be confusing to cheer for both sides... 
13,29,132,BARRY,"Yeah, weird huh? "
13,29,133,DAWN,Weird? Yeah... 
13,29,134,ASH,All right... you're up next! 
13,29,135,INFERNAPE,[APPEARING] 
13,29,136,JAMES,My stars! 
13,29,137,MEOWTH,Pal 'o mine! 
13,29,138,JESSIE,"Infernape, the Pokémon with issues! "
13,29,139,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",This team's on a selling break! 
13,29,140,ANNOUNCER,And Ash's second Pokémon is... Infernape! 
13,29,141,CYNTHIA,So Ash's Chimchar has evolved... 
13,29,142,CHIMCHAR,[APPEARING] 
13,29,143,ASH,"Infernape! Let's show Paul just how powerfully awesome you've become, okay? "
13,29,144,INFERNAPE,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,29,145,PAUL,Now Aggron! Use Double-Edge! 
13,29,146,ANNOUNCER,And Paul continues to battle with Aggron! 
13,29,147,ASH,"All right! Flare Blitz, let's go! "
13,29,148,INFERNAPE,[FLARE BLITZ MOVE] 
13,29,149,ANNOUNCER,And Infernape counters with an equally powerful move! 
13,29,150,ASH,Go! 
13,29,151,AGGRON,[STRUGGLING] 
13,29,152,ANNOUNCER,And the moves of two powerful Pokémon collide centerfield! 
13,29,153,"AGGRON, INFERNAPE",[EXERTION] 
13,29,154,INFERNAPE,[PAINED] 
13,29,155,ANNOUNCER,Look out! Infernape's shaken by Flare Blitz's recoil! And Aggron?  
13,29,156,AGGRON,[ANGRY] 
13,29,157,ANNOUNCER,It appears Aggron is unaffected! 
13,29,158,ASH,"But, how come? "
13,29,159,DAWN,Why isn't Aggron affected? 
13,29,160,BROCK,"That's because Aggron has the Ability called Rock Head! So even if a move causing recoil damage is used, Rock Head blocks it! "
13,29,161,BARRY,Oh wow! What a handy Ability to have! 
13,29,162,AGGRON,[PAINED] 
13,29,163,PAUL,Wait... Is that...? 
13,29,164,ANNOUNCER,"Flare Blitz's additional effect is causing Aggron burn damage, and is it potent! "
13,29,165,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
13,29,166,BROCK,Sometimes you have to take a hit to return an even bigger one! 
13,29,167,BROCK,Flare Blitz has an additional effect that can inflict its opponent with a Burn! 
13,29,168,MEOWTH,Infernape's sure rocking the house! 
13,29,169,JAMES,"This calls for a poem! When times are tough, Infernape defines the phrase 'ready 'n rough'! "
13,29,170,JESSIE,That's 'rough n' ready rhyme king! 
13,29,171,ASH,"Now, Infernape, use Mach Punch! "
13,29,172,INFERNAPE,[MACH PUNCH MOVE] 
13,29,173,PAUL,"All right Aggron, fl*sh Cannon, let's Go! "
13,29,174,AGGRON,[fl*sh CANNON MOVE] 
13,29,175,INFERNAPE,[ATTACKING] 
13,29,176,ANNOUNCER,Talk about a fast Mach Punch...! 
13,29,177,AGGRON,[DAZED] 
13,29,178,REFEREE,Aggron is unable to battle! Infernape wins! 
13,29,179,ANNOUNCER,And Ash gets the first win of the match! 
13,29,180,ASH,"Yeah, Infernape, you did it! "
13,29,181,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
13,29,182,INFERNAPE,[PROUD] 
13,29,183,MEOWTH,My hero! 
13,29,184,MEOWTH,Infernape drips cool! 
13,29,185,JAMES,"And another poem! No matter the goal, Infernape is always on a winning roll! "
13,29,186,JESSIE,With five more Pokémon in its complete control! 
13,29,187,WOBBUFFET,[AGREEING] 
13,29,188,PIPLUP,[HAPPY] 
13,29,189,DAWN,"All right, way to go, Infernape and Ash! "
13,29,190,BARRY,"I can't believe I'm saying this Paul, but since you let Ash get the first win, I've got no choice but to fine you! "
13,29,191,BROCK,It's still early. Much too early to be able to predict how this will all turn out! 
13,29,192,PAUL,Gastrodon! Stand by for battle! 
13,29,193,ANNOUNCER,And Paul's second Pokémon is Gastrodon! 
13,29,194,POKEDEX,"Gastrodon. The Sea Slug Pokémon, and the evolved form of Shellos. A sturdy shell covered Gastrodon's back long ago. Its cells still contain evidence of it today. "
13,29,195,ASH,"Wow, a Gastrodon! Infernape, return! "
13,29,196,ASH,"I'm going to switch you out, so get a good rest! "
13,29,197,JESSIE,Hey! Why put Infernape into early retirement? 
13,29,198,JAMES,Perhaps the Twerp's switching antics will enable us to work during a break in the Battle action! 
13,29,199,MEOWTH,"So while Infernape takes five, let's get to some merchandizing jive! "
13,29,200,WOBBUFFET,[AGREEING] 
13,29,201,BARRY,"Ash really knows his stuff! If Gastrodon's up now, switching out Infernape's best... "
13,29,202,DAWN,"Since Gastrodon's a Water and Ground-type Pokémon, a Fire type like Infernape is clearly at a disadvantage! "
13,29,203,ASH,"Staraptor, I choose you! "
13,29,204,STARAPTOR,[APPEARING] 
13,29,205,ANNOUNCER,And Staraptor is Ash's third Pokémon! 
13,29,206,PAUL,First Pikachu... then Infernape... then Staraptor... I get it now! 
13,29,207,REGGIE,"So far, Ash has used the same Pokémon he used at Lake Acuity... "
13,29,208,REGGIE,And if that's true... I'll bet I can guess Ash's last three Pokémon! 
13,29,209,PAUL,Use Muddy Water!  
13,29,210,GASTRODON,[MUDDY WATER MOVE] 
13,29,211,ASH,"Quick att*ck, now! "
13,29,212,STARAPTOR,[QUICK att*ck MOVE] 
13,29,213,ANNOUNCER,They don't call it Quick att*ck for nothing! What speed! 
13,29,214,PAUL,"Gastrodon, let's go! "
13,29,215,GASTRODON,[COUNTER SHIELD MOVE] 
13,29,216,ANNOUNCER,What kind of move is that? Gastrodon's moving its head in a circle! 
13,29,217,ASH,What's going on? 
13,29,218,STARAPTOR,[PAINED] 
13,29,219,ASH,Could that be Counter Shield? 
13,29,220,ANNOUNCER,A unique att*ck indeed! Gastrodon created a barrier against Staraptor using Muddy Water! 
13,29,221,DAWN,No way!  
13,29,222,PIPLUP,[SHOCKED] 
13,29,223,BARRY,"Hey, I've seen that! "
13,29,224,BARRY,It looks exactly like the Counter Shield technique Ash used when he battled Fantina! 
13,29,225,DAWN,And Pikachu used it during the Lake Acuity Battle... 
13,29,226,DAWN,So who would've thought Paul would've used a Counter Shield! 
13,29,227,BROCK,Paul's adapted Ash's battle techniques... He took what he saw from their Battle and made it his own! 
13,29,228,BARRY,Now that's the kind of brilliant stuff I expect from a guy who's good enough to be a true rival of mine... Paul! 
13,29,229,REGGIE,There's a side of Paul that hasn't changed... Putting Ash off balance with his own moves before he starts gaining momentum is Paul through and through... 
13,29,230,REGGIE,So how is Ash going to battle back now using those six Pokémon? 
13,29,231,ASH,We can't get near them! 
13,29,232,ASH,"Got it! Staraptor, aim for Gastrodon's belly! Aerial Ace! "
13,29,233,STARAPTOR,[ARIEL ACE MOVE] 
13,29,234,ANNOUNCER,And Staraptor counterattacks with Aerial Ace! 
13,29,235,STARAPTOR,[ATTACKING] 
13,29,236,ASH,Do it! 
13,29,237,PAUL,"Gastrodon, Body Slam! "
13,29,238,GASTRODON,[EXERT] 
13,29,239,ANNOUNCER,And Gastrodon poises directly above Staraptor! 
13,29,240,ASH,Now what?  
13,29,241,GASTRODON,[BODY SLAM MOVE] 
13,29,242,STARAPTOR,[PAINED] 
13,29,243,STARAPTOR,[STRUGGLING] 
13,29,244,ANNNOUNCER,"And Gastrodon's got Staraptor pinned down, making full use of its soft body! A brilliant move! "
13,29,245,PIKACHU,[WORRIED]  
13,29,246,PIPLUP,[SHOCKED] 
13,29,247,BROCK,And it's not that Gastrodon is a heavy Pokémon... But that wouldn't stop Paul from training it or any of his Pokémon for different battle situations! 
13,29,248,MEOWTH,That move makes my back hurt... 
13,29,249,JAMES,That Gastrodon's no slouch! 
13,29,250,JESSIE,There is life after Infernape! 
13,29,251,WOBBUFFET,[AGREEING] 
13,29,252,ASH,"Get Gastrodon off your back, Staraptor, and do it right now! "
13,29,253,PIKACHU,[ENCOURAGING] 
13,29,254,STARAPTOR,[STRUGGLING] 
13,29,255,GASTRODON,[EXERTION] 
13,29,256,PAUL,"All right, use Water Pulse and sh**t it straight up! "
13,29,257,GASTRODON,[WATER PULSE MOVE] 
13,29,258,ANNOUNCER,Gastrodon fires with Water Pulse! 
13,29,259,ASH,What's Paul up to? 
13,29,260,PIKACHU,[CONCERNED] 
13,29,261,PIPLUP,[PANICKED] 
13,29,262,DAWN,Staraptor! Fly away! 
13,29,263,BARRY,It can't with Gastrodon plastered to its back! 
13,29,264,STARAPTOR,[STRUGGLING] 
13,29,265,PAUL,"No, not yet, Gastrodon... - "
13,29,266,ASH,Is he?  - 
13,29,267,BROCK,"Of course! Paul's strategy is to pull Gastrodon off at the very last minute, so that Water Pulse will land directly on Staraptor! "
13,29,268,DAWN,"Hurry up, Staraptor! "
13,29,269,PIPLUP,[PANICKED] 
13,29,270,STARAPTOR,[PANICKED] 
13,29,271,ANNOUNCER,Water Pulse's descending speed is increasing and gaining strength at the same time! 
13,29,272,GASTRODON,[FOCUSED] 
13,29,273,ASH,"I've got it! All right, Staraptor, use Close Combat by banging hard on the ground! "
13,29,274,PAUL,Wait a minute...That move!

13,29,281,STARAPTOR,[PAINED] 
13,29,282,ANNOUNCER,And Gastrodon unleashes a lightning quick mid-air att*ck on a dazed Staraptor! 
13,29,283,ASH,"Man, what a hit! Staraptor, return! "
13,29,284,REGGIE,I'm sure even Ash wasn't expecting Paul to use Ice Beam while his Pokémon was in mid-air. 
13,29,285,REGGIE,"At the same time, I can tell Paul had Gastrodon's move planned out in case Staraptor somehow got away... "
13,29,286,ASH,"It's not over... Nope! Let's go! Buizel, I choose you! "
13,29,287,BUIZEL,[APPEARING] 
13,29,288,ANNOUNCER,And Ash switches Staraptor with Buizel! 
13,29,289,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
13,29,290,DAWN,"Yeah, Buizel, you can do it! "
13,29,291,PAUL,"Number four is Buizel... Wow, you're pathetic and predictable! "
13,29,292,PAUL,So you're trying to turn the frustration your Pokémon felt when I b*at you then into your advantage now... 
13,29,293,PAUL,That's why you're using the same Pokémon this time! 
13,29,294,ASH,"Right, Paul! This is just what my Pokémon and I all want! We may have lost to you once, but it's not over 'cause I'm b*ating you no matter what, get it? "
13,29,295,BUIZEL,[AGREEING] 
13,29,296,GASTRODON,[CHALLENGING]

13,29,312,GASTRODON,[DAZED] 
13,29,313,REFEREE,Gastrodon is unable to battle! Buizel wins! 
13,29,314,ANNOUNCER,"And Gastrodon is eliminated, putting Ash on the board twice! "
13,29,315,ASH,Yes! That's two Pokémon down! 
13,29,316,ASH,"Buizel, that was an awesome job! "
13,29,317,BUIZEL,[PROUD] 
13,29,318,DAWN,Amazing! Ash got two wins before Paul even got one! 
13,29,319,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
13,29,320,BROCK,Let's just hope that Ash can keep his momentum up! 
13,29,321,BARRY,"If you don't get it together soon Paul, I'm going to have to fine you big time! "
13,29,322,JESSIE,Touché! The Twerp is totally on top!

13,29,329,PAUL,Drapion! Stand by for battle! 
13,29,330,DRAPION,[APPEARING] 
13,29,331,DRAPION,[EXERTION] 
13,29,332,REGGIE,So Drapion's Paul's third Pokémon ... 
13,29,333,REGGIE,I wonder if Ash has finally figured out that Paul's first two Pokémon losing is all part of his plan? He needs to! 
13,29,334,ANNOUNCER,And Paul's third Pokémon is... Drapion! 
13,29,335,POKEDEX,"Drapion, The Ogre Scorp Pokémon, and the evolved form of Skorupi. With its sturdy body, Drapion takes pride in its strength, defeating opponents without the need for poison. "

13,28,18,BROCK,Is that?

13,28,29,BARRY,"That was amazing, Ash! What's up with that? "
13,28,30,ASH,Barry! 
13,28,31,BARRY,"So, that was Flare Blitz, right? "
13,28,32,ASH,Yeah! 
13,28,33,BROCK,"Instead of using Flame Wheel, Infernape powered up by learning Flare Blitz! - That was great! - "
13,28,34,ASH,"Thanks! Wow, nice work, Infernape! "
13,28,35,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
13,28,36,INFERNAPE,[GRATEFUL] 
13,28,37,DAWN,"Flare Blitz looked really powerful, too! "
13,28,38,PIPLUP,[AGREEING] 
13,28,39,BROCK,"It is a powerful move, but you need to be careful using it. Like Pikachu using Volt Tackle, Infernape will sustain recoil damage! "
13,28,40,ASH,Right! 
13,28,41,INFERNAPE,[CONFIRMING] 
13,28,42,BARRY,"So, you're training hard to b*at Paul, aren't you? "
13,28,43,ASH,"Yeah, but I've got to defeat Conway first... "
13,28,44,BARRY,"Right! I forgot! So, this is your Pokémon team for today... You're going for pure power with those three! "
13,28,45,DAWN,I sure hope powerful Pokémon are enough to b*at Conway... 
13,28,46,CONWAY,"Kudos to Ash for Infernape learning Flare Blitz. So, it appears we'll be facing off against the team of Infernape, Torterra, and Glalie... "

13,28,71,JAMES,Don't decide all you want! 
13,28,72,ANNOUNCER,"The Trainers who will battle it out on the grass b*ttlefield are Conway and Ash!

13,28,78,NOCTOWL,[APPEARING] 
13,28,79,CONWAY,"I guess my prediction was a little off... Considering Ash's personality, I figured he'd use the Pokémon that had recently learned a new move... "

13,28,81,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
13,28,82,PIPLUP,[IMPRESSED] 
13,28,83,DAWN,I think that's one of the Pokémon Ash caught while in Johto! 
13,28,84,POKEDEX,"Noctowl. The Owl Pokémon, and the evolved form of Hoothoot. Noctowl's eyes have a special power that allows it to see in the faintest light as if it was the middle of the day. "
13,28,85,BARRY,"Brock, Ash's Noctowl's a different shiny color! "
13,28,86,BROCK,Yeah! 
13,28,87,BARRY,"Wait. Why isn't Ash using Infernape, now? "
13,28,88,BROCK,He may be planning to use Noctowl's speed to shake things up! 
13,28,89,JUDGE,Conway gets the first move! Begin! 
13,28,90,CONWAY,Shuckle! Use Withdraw! 
13,28,91,SHUCKLE,[WITHDRAW MOVE]

13,28,112,PIKACHU,[CONFUSED] 
13,28,113,DAWN,Hey what's Power Trick? 
13,28,114,PIPLUP,[CONFUSED] 
13,28,115,BROCK,"It's a move that switches a Pokémon's att*ck and defense stats. In Shuckle's case, its Defense is really high and its att*ck power is really low, but if that were to be switched using Power Trick... "
13,28,116,DAWN,...then Shuckle's att*ck power would become really high! 
13,28,117,BARRY,"That's right, but then its Defense would be really low. Conway wants to win this with one sh*t! "
13,28,118,ASH,"Noctowl, quick! Use Air Slash! "

13,28,145,DAWN,"Yeah, and Conway sure knows how to make total use of its spin! "
13,28,146,BROCK,"The big problem is, Donphan's att*ck is only half as effective if it ever gets deflected! Did Ash switch Pokémon because of a strategy change? "

13,28,209,LICKILICKY,[LICK MOVE] 
13,28,210,GIBLE,[DISTRUBED] 
13,28,211,DAWN,Lick overload! 
13,28,212,BARRY,Hope Gible can breathe.... 
13,28,213,PIPLUP,[DISTURBED] 
13,28,214,BROCK,"I know Lick can sometimes cause opponents to become paralyzed, but this seems like something more... "
13,28,215,GIBLE,[DISTURBED] 
13,28,216,ANNOUNCER,What an incredibly effective move! Gible can barely stand up! 
13,28,217,ASH,"Get a hold of yourself, Gible! Now use Dig! "
13,28,218,GIBLE,[DIG MOVE] 
13,28,219,ANNOUNCER,And Gible escapes by using Dig! But will Gible be able to att*ck? 
13,28,220,CONWAY,Don't let it go! Use Power Whip! 
13,28,221,LICKILICKY,[POWER WHIP MOVE] 
13,28,222,GIBLE,[SHOCKED] 
13,28,223,ANNOUNCER,"Lickilicky's versatile tongue is not your ordinary tongue for sure, as it digs out Gible from underground, using Power Whip! "
13,28,224,ASH,"Gible, return! "
13,28,225,GIBLE,[AFRAID] 
13,28,226,ASH,"You're up again, Noctowl! I choose you! "
13,28,227,NOCTOWL,[APPEARING] 
13,28,228,CONWAY,"A Flying type, of course! All right, Power Whip! "
13,28,229,NOCTOWL,[POWER WHIP MOVE] 
13,28,230,ANNOUNCER,It's not enough to reach Noctowl! 
13,28,231,ASH,"Air Slash, go! "
13,28,232,NOCTOWL,[AIR SLASH MOVE] 
13,28,233,LICKILICKY,[YELP] 
13,28,234,CONWAY,Use Thunderbolt instead! 
13,28,235,LICKILICKY,[THUNDERBOLT MOVE] 
13,28,236,ASH,"Quick, Noctowl, dodge it! "
13,28,237,NOCTOWL,[EXERTION] 
13,28,238,ANNOUNCER,"Quick is right, as Noctowl dodges Lickilicky's Thunderbolt! "
13,28,239,ASH,All right! Extrasensory! 
13,28,240,NOCTOWL,[EXTRASENSORY MOVE] 
13,28,241,LICKILICKY,[CONFUSED] 
13,28,242,ASH,"Now, throw it down! "
13,28,243,NOCTOWL,[EXTRASENSORY MOVE] 
13,28,244,LICKILICKY,[DAZED] 
13,28,245,JUDGE,Lickilicky is unable to battle! Noctowl wins! 
13,28,246,ANNOUNCER,"Lickilicky has been eliminated, and Conway is down to his last Pokémon! "
13,28,247,ASH,"Yes! Thanks, Noctowl! We did it! "
13,28,248,NOCTOWL,[PROUD] 
13,28,249,BARRY,Ash's on a roll! 
13,28,250,DAWN,He's amazing! 
13,28,251,PIKACHU,[CHEERING] 
13,28,252,PIPLUP,[CHEERING] 
13,28,253,BROCK,Gible mastering Draco Meteor has really given Ash some serious momentum! 
13,28,254,MEOWTH,I can totally dig why you guys ditched working with all this Twerp action happening on the tube! 
13,28,255,JAMES,The Twerp may well win it in one fell swoop! 
13,28,256,JESSIE,But he is still a Twerp... 
13,28,257,CONWAY,"Lickilicky, return! Excellent work! Dusknoir, let's go! "
13,28,258,DUSKNOIR,[APPEARING] 
13,28,259,CONWAY,"Dusknoir, Trick Room! "
13,28,260,DUSKNOIR,[TRICK ROOM MOVE] 
13,28,261,ASH,What's going on? 
13,28,262,CONWAY,"Ash, welcome to Trick Room! Its effects last even if it's no longer visible, so I would suggest you keep that in mind! "
13,28,263,BARRY,This is the first time I've seen that move! 
13,28,264,DAWN,It really looked like they were trapped inside a room! 
13,28,265,BROCK,"It's possible Conway used Shuckle and Lickilicky just so he could figure out which Pokémon Ash was going to use, so Conway could turn around and use Trick Room! "
13,28,266,ASH,"Okay, Extrasensory! "
13,28,267,NOCTOWL,[EXTRASENSORY MOVE] 
13,28,268,CONWAY,Use Thunder Punch! 
13,28,269,DUSKNOIR,[AFFIRMATIVE]

13,28,271,DUSKNOIR,[THUNDER PUNCH MOVE] 
13,28,272,NOCTOWL,[YELP] 
13,28,273,ASH,"No, Noctowl! "
13,28,274,NOCTOWL,[PAIN] 
13,28,275,JUDGE,Noctowl is unable to battle! Dusknoir wins! 
13,28,276,ANNOUNCER,"Conway fires back fiercely, as Dusknoir eliminates Noctowl with a single move and leaves Ash with just two Pokémon! "
13,28,277,ASH,Dusknoir moved so quickly I didn't see it coming! 
13,28,278,CONWAY,"Noctowl's super flying speed, and Donphan's spinning speed, as well as Gible's Dig... their speeds are all incredible! And that makes this Trick Room all the more useful, of course! "
13,28,279,CONWAY,"You see, this powerful move enables the slowest Pokémon to launch an att*ck first! Which means while Trick Room is in effect, my slow Dusknoir has an advantage by always having the opportunity to strike before any of your Pokémon has a chance! "
13,28,280,ASH,I've never even heard of that move... 
13,28,281,BARRY,Trick Room sounds really scary! 
13,28,282,BROCK,"Up until now, it looked like the wind was at Ash's back, but it was all happening according to Conway's plan! "
13,28,283,ASH,"Noctowl, return! Thanks a lot. Now you get a good rest! "
13,28,284,CONWAY,So! Which of your Pokémon are going down next? 
13,28,285,ASH,"Look, the battle's not over yet! Donphan, I choose you! "
13,28,286,DONPHAN,[APPEARING] 
13,28,287,ANNOUNCER,And Trick Room is still in effect! Will Ash be able to counter it? 
13,28,288,ASH,"All right! Donphan, use Rollout! "
13,28,289,CONWAY,Use Shadow Punch! 
13,28,290,DONPHAN,[ROLLOUT MOVE] 
13,28,291,DUSKNOIR,[SHADOW PUNCH MOVE] 
13,28,292,DONPHAN,[GROAN] 
13,28,293,ASH,"Donphan! Oh man... No matter what I do, Dusknoir's able to strike first! I'd better switch! Donphan, return! - "
13,28,294,CONWAY,Mean Look! - 
13,28,295,ASH,What? 
13,28,296,DUSKNOIR,[MEAN LOOK MOVE] 
13,28,297,ASH,Oh no! 
13,28,298,ANNOUNCER,"Donphan is hit with Mean Look, so Ash won't be able to switch Pokémon! "
13,28,299,BARRY,"If Donphan's been hit with Mean Look, there's nowhere to run! What's Ash going to do? "
13,28,300,CONWAY,"It's the end of the line, Ash. Shadow Punch! "
13,28,301,DUSKNOIR,[SHADOW PUNCH MOVE] 
13,28,302,DONPHAN,[YELP] 
13,28,303,ASH,"No, Donphan! "

13,28,305,JUDGE,Donphan is unable to battle! Dusknoir wins! 
13,28,306,ANNOUNCER,Dusknoir takes out two of Ash's Pokémon! Both sides have one left! 
13,28,307,CONWAY,"I hope you're enjoying the effects of Trick Room... And, it's still going strong! "
13,28,308,ASH,"Donphan, return! You were totally awesome! Thanks! All right, here we go! Gible, I choose you! "
13,28,309,GIBLE,[APPEARING] 
13,28,310,ANNOUNCER,And Trick Room reveals itself again! How will Ash deal with it this time? 
13,28,311,CONWAY,Draco Meteor may have beaten Shuckle but it won't work this time! 
13,28,312,ASH,"Gible, use Dig! "
13,28,313,GIBLE,[DIG MOVE] 
13,28,314,CONWAY,Use Shadow Punch! 
13,28,315,DUSKNOIR,[SHADOW PUNCH MOVE] 
13,28,316,GIBLE,[YELP] 
13,28,317,ANNOUNCER,And Dusknoir strikes first again! Gible has been hurtled into the ground! 
13,28,318,ASH,"We're just fine! Gible, go! "
13,28,319,ASH,"Gible, straight up! "
13,28,320,GIBLE,[EXERTION] 
13,28,321,CONWAY,I don't think so! Use Shadow Punch! 
13,28,322,DUSKNOIR,[SHADOW PUNCH MOVE] 
13,28,323,ASH,Gible! Bite that Shadow Punch! 
13,28,324,CONWAY,What?

13,28,326,DUSKNOIR,[SHADOW PUNCH MOVE] 
13,28,327,GIBLE,[EXERTION] 
13,28,328,DUSKNOIR,[SHOCK] 
13,28,329,CONWAY,What kind of move is that? It ate the Shadow Punch! 
13,28,330,GIBLE,[EXERTION] 
13,28,331,DUSKNOIR,[SHOCK] 
13,28,332,ASH,Gible! Draco Meteor! 
13,28,333,GIBLE,[DRACO METEOR MOVE] 
13,28,334,DUSKNOIR,[YELP] 
13,28,335,ASH,Use Dragon Pulse! 
13,28,336,GIBLE,[PREPARING] 
13,28,337,CONWAY,"Dusknoir, use Shadow Punch once more! "
13,28,338,DUSKNOIR,[SHADOW PUNCH MOVE]

13,28,345,ASH,"All right! Gible, you showed them! "
13,28,346,ASH,Thanks so much Gible! You were just amazing! 
13,28,347,GIBLE,[HAPPY] 
13,28,348,MEOWTH,He ripped it! 
13,28,349,JESSIE,Twerps get it right sometimes... 
13,28,350,JAMES,I say we grab that gifted Gible... 
13,28,351,DAWN,He won! Now he's off to the fourth round! 
13,28,352,BARRY,I can't stand it! I'm fining that guy! 
13,28,353,BROCK,"Well, though that was a tough battle, Gible finally mastering Draco Meteor was key! "
13,28,354,CONWAY,"Dusknoir, return! Excellent work! This has got to be the least calculated battle I've ever seen! At least a new battle equation has been inputted into my database... "
13,28,355,ANNOUNCER,"Folks, we have our top eight Trainers! We will now randomly shuffle our top eight to determine the match ups for round four, the quarterfinals, taking place tomorrow! "
13,28,356,ANNOUNCER,"And there they are! The battle format will change to a six-on-six Full Battle, which means The Sinnoh League tournament is sure to heat up even more! "
13,28,357,DAWN,Ash against Paul... 
13,28,358,BARRY,It's about time! Ash and Paul are finally going to battle it out! 
13,28,359,BROCK,And Gible gets today's gallantry award! Eat all you want! 
13,28,360,"GIBLE, NOCTOWL, DONPHAN",[GRATEFUL] / [EATING]

13,28,362,PIPLUP,[HAPPY] 
13,28,363,ASH,"Thanks a lot, Gible, Noctowl, and Donphan. I'll work hard in round four! And that's a promise! "
13,28,364,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] - 
13,28,365,BARRY,It's Paul! - 
13,28,366,ASH,Hey Paul! 
13,28,367,ASH,So! Are you fine-tuning your Pokémon? 
13,28,368,PAUL,Yeah. 
13,28,369,ELECTIVIRE,[ANGRY] 
13,28,370,PIKACHU,[DETERMINED] 
13,28,371,CYNTHIA,It's Paul versus Ash... I'm really looking forward to their battle! 
13,28,372,NARRATOR,"And so, Ash advances to round four, the quarterfinals, where a battle with Paul promises some red-hot excitement! So stay tuned for two longtime rivals, going head-to-head! "
13,28,373,ASH,"I got Buizel, Professor! "
13,28,374,PROFESSOR OAK,"Good! Noctowl and the others are all in good hands! So, waiting for your third Pokémon for tomorrow? "
13,28,375,ASH,Right! It should be here any minute now! 
13,28,376,PIPLUP,[HAPPY] 
13,28,377,PIKACHU,[HAPPY] 
13,28,378,DAWN,Hey Ash! It's here! 
13,28,379,ASH,Really? 
13,28,380,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
13,28,381,BROCK,Ash! Look! 
13,28,382,ASH,I've been waiting... Gliscor! 
13,28,383,GLISCOR,[EXCITED
13,27,0,NARRATOR,"The Sinnoh League Tournament at Lily of the Valley Island is in full swing! And after defeating Nando, Ash is now battling his round two opponent. "

13,27,3,GRUMPIG,[DAZED] 
13,27,4,JUDGE,"Grumpig is unable to battle! Snorlax is the winner, and the victor is Ash from Pallet Town! "

13,27,9,BROCK,Conway can be pretty slick... Be careful! 
13,27,10,ASH,You bet I will! 
13,27,11,PIKACHU,[DETERMINED] 
13,27,12,DAWN,Just give it your all!

13,27,15,CONWAY,...as long as you're cheering me on! 
13,27,16,DAWN,"Hi, Conway! "
13,27,17,CONWAY,"After all, I happen to have a secret strategy for defeating Ash. "
13,27,18,ASH,Secret? 
13,27,19,PIKACHU,[CONFUSED] 
13,27,20,CONWAY,Of course! And it's the kind of strategy only I could employ! 
13,27,21,CONWAY,"What? You want to know? I guess I'll make a special exception for you, Dawn. "
13,27,22,DAWN,I never asked... 
13,27,23,CONWAY,"No need to be shy! So, come, lend me your ears... "
13,27,24,DAWN,Back off! 
13,27,25,BARRY,"Hey, what's the big idea of bumping into me? "
13,27,26,ASH,Barry! 
13,27,27,BARRY,I'm fining you for bumping into me right before my battle! 
13,27,28,DAWN,You're the one who bumped into me! 
13,27,29,BROCK,"Now, now... "
13,27,30,ASH,Barry. Where are you going in such a hurry? 
13,27,31,BARRY,To go see Paul! 
13,27,32,ASH,See Paul? 
13,27,33,BARRY,"Right! Because no matter how you look at it, Paul and I are the top two contenders in the tournament! BARRY ["
13,27,34,CONT'D],"And now, the top two seeds are going to battle head-to-head! It gets lonely at the top, but Paul's there to keep me company! "
13,27,35,DAWN,Tell us how you really feel... 
13,27,36,BARRY,I was just on my way to let Paul know all this! 
13,27,37,ASH,I don't get it... 
13,27,38,CONWAY,You're over my head... 
13,27,39,BARRY,I'm what? 
13,27,40,DAWN,"Barry, I wouldn't do that if I were you. "
13,27,41,BARRY,Why not? 
13,27,42,DAWN,"Because I know exactly what Paul's going to say, ""You? Who are you?"" "
13,27,43,BARRY,No way! Paul will definitely know who I am! 
13,27,44,DAWN,"Even if Paul does know you, he'll say, ""You're pathetic and no match for me..."" "
13,27,45,BARRY,"No, no, no! A Trainer at his high level of skill has to know who I am! And I'll prove it! "
13,27,46,DAWN,"Barry, wait! "
13,27,47,ANNOUNCER,"All of today's battles are complete. Everyone, please have a safe trip home. "
13,27,48,MEOWTH,"Swing it on over, foodie fans! "
13,27,49,JAMES,It's gourmet chow time! 
13,27,50,JESSIE,Delectable Pokémon rice crackers and bean buns!

13,27,52,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,27,53,JAMES,"Ahh, the customer crunch! "
13,27,54,JESSIE,With Lily of the Valley pennants with lunch! 
13,27,55,MEOWTH,And we'll throw in a Jessilina and Meowth doll to hug while you munch! 
13,27,56,JAMES,Where's our selling prowess? 
13,27,57,JESSIE,Obviously this Meowth monstrosity's the culprit... 
13,27,58,MEOWTH,I think this monster's scaring them all away! - 
13,27,59,JESSIE,"Oh, yeah? - "
13,27,60,MEOWTH,"Oh, yeah! "
13,27,61,JAMES,Let's see... The Boss lady set us up here for one reason... because she was impressed with our excellent way with a sale! 
13,27,62,JESSIE,It could be we're barking right where people are leaving... 
13,27,63,MEOWTH,"Instead, we should be hawking our mounds of merchandise inside the stadium, where the action is! "
13,27,64,JAMES,"But the action is where we make it, and for now, that's right here! The ladder of success starts with the first rung! "
13,27,65,MEOWTH,"So, let's calmly check out why we're not connecting with the maddening crowd! "
13,27,66,JESSIE,Time for analysis. 
13,27,67,"JAMES, MEOWTH",Yes! 
13,27,68,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",We'll show the Boss we can sell to the moon and back! 
13,27,69,BARRY,There you are! 
13,27,70,BARRY,"Yeah, you, Paul! "
13,27,71,BARRY,Wait! 
13,27,72,BARRY,"Paul, you're looking at my data, aren't you? "
13,27,73,PAUL,Yeah... 
13,27,74,BARRY,"Now, did you hear that, you guys? BARRY ["
13,27,75,CONT'D],"Paul just proved that the strong know who the strong are! And he's looking at my data because that's just what I am! So, you can come up with a strategy, correct? "
13,27,76,PAUL,Data's important... 
13,27,77,BARRY,"Totally awesome! However! You can gather all the data you want, but it's useless! "
13,27,78,DAWN,Really? Why? 
13,27,79,BARRY,Don't you see? Every second of every hour of every day I'm getting better! Outdated data is useless! 
13,27,80,BROCK,"Well if this were a talking tournament, you'd win first prize... "
13,27,81,BARRY,Jealous! 
13,27,82,BARRY,"Look Paulthe truth is, our battle will determine the title of top Trainer! So, with that in mind, let's give them all one awesome event! "
13,27,83,PAUL,Our battle is only one of many battles taking place in the third round... PAUL [
13,27,84,CONT'D],Overestimating your ability will only backfire on you! 
13,27,85,BARRY,What's your problem? Hey! 
13,27,86,PAUL,I'm looking forward to battling you. No doubt. 
13,27,87,BARRY,Now that's what I call a worthy opponent! Yup! That's Paul! 
13,27,88,DAWN,Barry? Found Paul's data yet? 
13,27,89,BARRY,I've researched everything on him but it's all outdated. There's not one thing that's current! So if Paul were to use a Pokémon that's not found in the database... 
13,27,90,ASH,You're done for? 
13,27,91,BARRY,I didn't say that! 
13,27,92,BROCK,How about the data on Conway? 
13,27,93,ASH,It says he's an impulsive Pokémon Trainer with many different battle styles. 
13,27,94,DAWN,Then that means he's unpredictable? 
13,27,95,PIPLUP,[SURPRISED] 
13,27,96,CONWAY,Right. It's a big part of my appeal! 
13,27,97,"ASH, DAWN, BARRY, PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[SURPRISED] 
13,27,98,ASH,Conway? What are you doing? 
13,27,99,CONWAY,Just a little research... 
13,27,100,BROCK,"Better do more than a little, because Ash is no pushover! "
13,27,101,CONWAY,Not Ash. I was looking up Tobias's data. 
13,27,102,ASH,Tobias? 
13,27,103,CONWAY,He's the Trainer who won both his first and second round using only his Darkrai the whole time... 
13,27,104,ASH,"Only Darkrai for the second round, too? "
13,27,105,CONWAY,True. And that's not all. Tobias won all eight of his Gym battles using only his Darkrai as well! 
13,27,106,DAWN,"But Conway, why are you looking up Tobias's data? "
13,27,107,CONWAY,"Because at some point we might get matched up... after I b*at Ash, of course. "
13,27,108,ASH,What was that? 
13,27,109,CONWAY,"Well, then! Have yourself a lovely night. Bye, Dawn. "
13,27,110,"DAWN, PIPLUP",[PERPLEXED] 
13,27,111,BARRY,I give up! No sense in making myself nuts.... 
13,27,112,ASH,Now that's the spirit! Just go for it! 
13,27,113,BARRY,You're right! Just go for it! 
13,27,114,DAWN,Like you're going for broke! 
13,27,115,BARRY,Ash! Want to go for a run? 
13,27,116,ASH,You bet! That's a great idea! 
13,27,117,"ASH, BARRY, PIKACHU",[EXCITED] 
13,27,118,DAWN,What are they running for? 
13,27,119,BROCK,They're trying to burn off some of their excitement! 
13,27,120,BARRY,"Tomorrow, I'm going to be battling against Paul in front of a huge crowd! I am so psyched! "
13,27,121,ASH,"Yeah, me too! And no matter what kind of battle I have with Conway, I'm not going to lose! "
13,27,122,BARRY,"Yeah, hey! Look, look! There's my victory star! "
13,27,123,ASH,"No way, it's my victory star! "
13,27,124,BARRY,"Yes way, it's my star! "
13,27,125,ASH,"No, it's mine! "
13,27,126,BARRY,Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! 
13,27,127,ASH,Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! 
13,27,128,MC,"Welcome to the Sinnoh League Tournament at Lily of the Valley Island! And beginning with round three, all battles will take place here in the main stadium! MC ["
13,27,129,CONT'D],"In addition, the field will change randomly after every battle! So, the b*ttlefield for the first of the round three battles will be rocky terrain, and our two battling Trainers are... MC ["
13,27,130,CONT'D],"...Barry and Paul, making it sure to be a heated exchange! "
13,27,131,ASH,Wow! I am so psyched! 
13,27,132,PIKACHU,[CHEERING] 
13,27,133,BROCK,Can't wait to see what kind of strategies they'll be coming up with! 
13,27,134,DAWN,"Yeah, me too! "
13,27,135,PIPLUP,[CHEERING] 
13,27,136,MC,"So, as we await their Pokémon... "
13,27,137,BARRY,"All right, Skarmory, let's get going! "
13,27,138,SKARMORY,[APPEARING] 
13,27,139,PAUL,"Magmortar, stand by for battle! "
13,27,140,MAGMORTAR,[APPEARING] 
13,27,141,MC,And it's Magmortar and Skarmory! 
13,27,142,POKEDEX,Skarmory. The Armor Bird Pokémon. Skarmory's body is covered with a steel-like armor and can fly at speeds of over one hundred miles per hour. 
13,27,143,ASH,"Of course, Skarmory's a Steel type... "
13,27,144,BROCK,And Steel types have a disadvantage against Fire types like Magmortar. 
13,27,145,MC,So get ready for the three-on-three battles of the third round! 
13,27,146,JUDGE,Barry will have first move! Begin! 
13,27,147,BARRY,"Skarmory, use Spikes! "
13,27,148,SKARMORY,[SPIKES MOVE] 
13,27,149,MC,And Barry uses Spikes without missing a b*at! 
13,27,150,BROCK,"Now whenever Paul switches out a Pokémon, it'll sustain damage! "
13,27,151,ASH,That's because Spikes' effect won't wear out! 
13,27,152,PIKACHU,[CHEERING] 
13,27,153,PAUL,"Magmortar, use Flamethrower! "
13,27,154,MAGMORTAR,[FLAMETHROWER MOVE] 
13,27,155,SKARMORY,[GRUNT] 
13,27,156,BARRY,"Skarmory, no! "
13,27,157,SKARMORY,[DAZED] 
13,27,158,JUDGE,Skarmory is unable to battle! Magmortar is the winner! 
13,27,159,BROCK,"Fire-type moves are super effective against Steel types, and this proves it! "
13,27,160,ASH,Skarmory's out in one move! 
13,27,161,BARRY,"Thanks, Skarmory. You were great! I know Fire-types are weak against Water-types, so all right then Empoleon, let's get going! "
13,27,162,EMPOLEON,[APPEARING] 
13,27,163,BARRY,Hydro Cannon! 
13,27,164,EMPOLEON,[HYDRO CANNON MOVE] 
13,27,165,MAGMORTAR,[GROAN] 
13,27,166,DAWN,What a hit! 
13,27,167,ASH,That did a lot of damage! 
13,27,168,BARRY,"And of course if Paul switches his Pokémon, it'll sustain damage, no matter which one he chooses! "
13,27,169,BARRY,"Guess you can't change your Pokémon, can you Paul? "
13,27,170,PAUL,Return! 
13,27,171,BARRY,"Hold on! You can't be serious, can you? "
13,27,172,PAUL,"Now, Ursaring, stand by for battle! "
13,27,173,URSARING,[APPEARING] 
13,27,174,URSARING,[GROAN] 
13,27,175,MC,And Ursaring is sustaining damage from the effects of Spikes! 
13,27,176,BARRY,"In that case, I'm switching my Pokémon! Return! "
13,27,177,BARRY,A Normal type like Ursaring is weak against a Fighting type! 
13,27,178,HITMONLEE,[APPEARING] 
13,27,179,MC,And Barry brings out Hitmonlee! 
13,27,180,POKEDEX,"Hitmonlee. The Kicking Pokémon, and the evolved form of Tyrogue. Its legs double in length, and opponents are surprised by Hitmonlee's att*ck range when facing it for the first time. "
13,27,181,PAUL,"Bulk Up, let's go! "
13,27,182,URSARING,[BULK UP MOVE] 
13,27,183,BROCK,Now Ursaring's att*ck and defense powers have increased! 
13,27,184,DAWN,"But even without Bulk Up, Ursaring was strong! "
13,27,185,BARRY,"Let's get the folks to know you with one of your best moves! Hitmonlee, Mega Kick! "
13,27,186,HITMONLEE,[MEGA KICK MOVE] 
13,27,187,URSARING,[GRUNT] 
13,27,188,ASH,That's fast! 
13,27,189,PAUL,Use Hammer Arm! 
13,27,190,URSARING,[HAMMER ARM MOVE] 
13,27,191,MC,And Ursaring fires back with Hammer Arm! 
13,27,192,MC,"Wow, Hitmonlee dodged it! "
13,27,193,BARRY,I raised my Hitmonlee's speed up to maximum levels through lots of hard training! 
13,27,194,PAUL,"Is that so? Use Slash, back to back! "
13,27,195,URSARING,[SLASH MOVE] 
13,27,196,HITMONLEE,[SURPRISED] 
13,27,197,URSARING,[SLASH MOVE] 
13,27,198,BARRY,"Quick, dodge, dodge, and dodge! "
13,27,199,HITMONLEE,[EXERTION] 
13,27,200,BARRY,Close Combat! 
13,27,201,HITMONLEE,[CLOSE COMBAT MOVE] 
13,27,202,MC,Hitmonlee's speedy Close Combat nails it time after time! - 
13,27,203,BARRY,Take that! - 
13,27,204,PAUL,Use Hammer Arm! 
13,27,205,URSARING,[HAMMER ARM MOVE] 
13,27,206,HITMONLEE,[YELP] 
13,27,207,BARRY,"I'm counting on you, Hitmonlee! "
13,27,208,HITMONLEE,[EXERTION] 
13,27,209,BARRY,All right! High Jump Kick! 
13,27,210,HITMONLEE,[HIGH JUMP KICK MOVE] 
13,27,211,URSARING,[EXERTION] 
13,27,212,HITMONLEE,[HIGH JUMP KICK MOVE] 
13,27,213,URSARING,[YELP] 
13,27,214,MC,And Hitmonlee lands an effective High Jump Kick! 
13,27,215,BROCK,That's courage and strategy. You can see that Barry definitely earned his spot here in the third round! 
13,27,216,PAUL,Focus Blast! 
13,27,217,URSARING,[FOCUS BLAST MOVE] 
13,27,218,BARRY,"Dodge it, quick! "
13,27,219,HITMONLEE,[EXERTION] 
13,27,220,HITMONLEE,[PAIN] 
13,27,221,PAUL,Let's finish this up with Hammer Arm! 
13,27,222,URSARING,[HAMMER ARM MOVE] 
13,27,223,BARRY,Hitmonlee! We're coming around the final turn! Use Blaze Kick! 
13,27,224,HITMONLEE,[BLAZE KICK MOVE] 
13,27,225,URSARING,[YELP] 
13,27,226,MC,And Himonlee's expl*sive Blaze Kick plows into Ursaring! 
13,27,227,URSARING,[GROAN] 
13,27,228,MC,"On top of that, there's the added effect of Blaze Kick! "
13,27,229,ASH,"Good job, Barry! Finish it off! "
13,27,230,BROCK,Too easy! 
13,27,231,BROCK,"Ursaring's Ability is Guts. So, when its status has been affected, like with burn or poison, its att*ck power grows! "
13,27,232,URSARING,[ANGRY] 
13,27,233,HITMONLEE,[SURPRISED] 
13,27,234,BARRY,"Hitmonlee, stay strong! Finish it off with Blaze Kick! "
13,27,235,HITMONLEE,[BLAZE KICK MOVE] 
13,27,236,PAUL,"Use Hammer Arm, now! "
13,27,237,URSARING,[HAMMER ARM MOVE] 
13,27,238,MC,It's a collision of Hitmonlee and Ursaring's moves! 
13,27,239,HITMONLEE,[DAZED] 
13,27,240,BARRY,Hitmonlee! 
13,27,241,JUDGE,Hitmonlee is unable to battle! Ursaring's the winner! 
13,27,242,MC,"Ursaring wins it! And Hammer Arm, powered up by its Ability, Guts, seals that win! "
13,27,243,JESSIE,"Well, they're having fun... "
13,27,244,MEOWTH,"Yeah. It's a party in the stadium, while out here you can hear paint dry... "
13,27,245,MURKROW,[CAWING] 
13,27,246,JAMES,"Quit being a couple of sad sacks! Our goal is to sell our wares to the masses exiting the venue, lest we soon forget! "
13,27,247,JESSIE,But our wares are a big yawn... 
13,27,248,JAMES,We'll have a ware swap! 
13,27,249,"JESSIE, MEOWTH",Ware swap? 
13,27,250,JAMES,It's the same as switching your Pokémon! Why hawk the same bean buns and t-shirts as everyone else? 
13,27,251,JESSIE,Translate that please... 
13,27,252,JAMES,"I said, we'll simply switch our merchandise to suit the unique taste of our customers! "
13,27,253,MEOWTH,Take another sh*t! 
13,27,254,JAMES,These spectators will want likenesses of the very same Pokémon they watched in battle! JAMES [
13,27,255,CONT'D],And that's where we come in! 
13,27,256,JESSIE,Like new product lines just grow on trees... 
13,27,257,JAMES,"You leave the details to the boss lady and me, and you'll see! Yippee! "
13,27,258,ASH,Empoleon's Barry's last Pokémon... 
13,27,259,DAWN,While Paul still has all three of his Pokémon to work with! 
13,27,260,BROCK,"So, everything Barry does is crucial! "
13,27,261,BARRY,"All right, Empoleon, let's get going! "
13,27,262,EMPOLEON,[APPEARING] 
13,27,263,MC,"It's do-or-die for Barry, as Paul and Ursaring could win this battle right here! "
13,27,264,PAUL,"Ursaring, quick! Use Slash, let's go! "
13,27,265,URSARING,[SLASH MOVE] 
13,27,266,BARRY,"Empoleon, Drill Peck! "
13,27,267,EMPOLEON,[DRILL PECK MOVE] 
13,27,268,MC,"And again, two powerful moves collide! "
13,27,269,EMPOLEON,[EXERTION] 
13,27,270,MC,Were they evenly matched? 
13,27,271,PAUL,"Ursaring, use Focus Blast! "
13,27,272,URSARING,[FOCUS BLAST MOVE] 
13,27,273,BARRY,Send it right back! 
13,27,274,EMPOLEON,[EXERTION] 
13,27,275,URSARING,[GROAN] 
13,27,276,PAUL,But how? 
13,27,277,BARRY,"How do you like that? Now, give me everything you've got! "
13,27,278,PAUL,Return! 
13,27,279,MC,And another Pokémon substitution! 
13,27,280,PAUL,"Electivire, stand by for battle! "
13,27,281,ELECTIVIRE,[APPEARING] / [ROAR] 
13,27,282,POKEDEX,"Electivire. The Thunderbolt Pokémon, and the evolved form of Electabuzz. When Electivire att*cks, it pushes the tips of its two tails against its opponent. "
13,27,283,ASH,Paul's Electabuzz evolved into Electivire! 
13,27,284,PIKACHU,[CONCERNED] 
13,27,285,BROCK,Electric-type moves are super effective on a Water type. Paul always seems to stay cool and calm and ends up going for a sure victory! 
13,27,286,DAWN,"So now, how is Barry going to battle using Empoleon? "
13,27,287,BARRY,"Pokémon type and advantages won't matter using this move! All right, Hyper Beam! "
13,27,288,EMPOLEON,[HYPER BEAM MOVE] 
13,27,289,PAUL,Use Thunder! 
13,27,290,ELECTIVIRE,[THUNDER MOVE] 
13,27,291,MC,And yet another collision of moves! But are they evenly matched? 
13,27,292,BROCK,The aftereffects of using Hyper Beam will leave Empoleon wide open! 
13,27,293,EMPOLEON,[TIRED] 
13,27,294,PAUL,Now use Thunder Punch! 
13,27,295,ELECTIVIRE,[THUNDER PUNCH MOVE] 
13,27,296,BARRY,"Quick, dodge it! "
13,27,297,EMPOLEON,[EXERTION] 
13,27,298,BARRY,See that? My Empoleon's speed is at the maximum level it can be! It's not such an easy moving target... 
13,27,299,PAUL,"Thunder Punch, back to back! "
13,27,300,ELECTIVIRE,[THUNDER PUNCH MOVE] 
13,27,301,EMPOLEON,[EXERTION] 
13,27,302,BARRY,"Dodge them all, Empoleon! Dodge them all! "
13,27,303,EMPOLEON,[AFRAID] 
13,27,304,PAUL,Use Giga Impact! 
13,27,305,ELECTIVIRE,[GIGA IMPACT MOVE] 
13,27,306,MC,Now there's a powerful move! 
13,27,307,BARRY,"You can do it, Empoleon! "
13,27,308,EMPOLEON,[EXERTION] 
13,27,309,PAUL,"Thunder Punch, let's go! "
13,27,310,EMPOLEON,[THUNDER PUNCH MOVE] 
13,27,311,BARRY,"Come on, dodge it! "
13,27,312,ELECTIVIRE,[THUNDER PUNCH MOVE] 
13,27,313,EMPOLEON,[YELP] 
13,27,314,MC,"Whoa, that couldn't have been fun! "
13,27,315,BARRY,"No, Empoleon! "
13,27,316,MC,Empoleon has sustained a lot of damage! So is it all over? 
13,27,317,BARRY,Empoleon... Come on... You can do it... You can do it! 
13,27,318,EMPOLEON,[FOCUS] / [EXERTION] 
13,27,319,BARRY,Empoleon? 
13,27,320,DAWN,Is that? 
13,27,321,ASH,That's right! I forgot that Empoleon's Ability is Torrent! 
13,27,322,BROCK,"Its energy might be lacking, but its Water-type moves have really powered up! "
13,27,323,EMPOLEON,[ANGRY] 
13,27,324,BARRY,"All right! Hydro Cannon, let's go! "
13,27,325,EMPOLEON,[HYDRO CANNON MOVE] 
13,27,326,ASH,"Awesome power, wow! "
13,27,327,DAWN,This might be it! 
13,27,328,PAUL,"Quick, Electivire, Protect! "
13,27,329,ELECTIVIRE,[PROTECT MOVE] 
13,27,330,MC,And Electivire completely shields itself from Empoleon's Hydro Cannon using Protect! 
13,27,331,BARRY,"All right, so what's the big idea of using Protect? "
13,27,332,EMPOLEON,[PAINED] 
13,27,333,PAUL,"Use Thunder, now! "
13,27,334,ELECTIVIRE,[THUNDER MOVE] 
13,27,335,BARRY,And dodge it! 
13,27,336,ELECTIVIRE,[CONFUSED] 
13,27,337,BARRY,Empoleon! 
13,27,338,JUDGE,Empoleon is unable to battle! And the winner is Paul from Veilstone City! 
13,27,339,MC,Paul and Electivire have won the third round match with a decisive three-zero victory against Barry! 
13,27,340,BARRY,"Thanks! Empoleon, you were awesome! "
13,27,341,EMPOLEON,[SORRY] 
13,27,342,BARRY,Now you take a good rest! 
13,27,343,BARRY,Paul won... 
13,27,344,JAMES,The Boss lady did it! She switched our merchandise with a smile! 
13,27,345,"MEOWTH, JESSIE, WOBBUFFET",[SHOCK] 
13,27,346,MEOWTH,"So, let's step on it because the last match just ended! "
13,27,347,JESSIE,And there'll be a crush of consumers coming our way! 
13,27,348,"JESSIE, JAMES","Folks, feast your eyes on these! "
13,27,349,JAMES,Adorable keepsakes of the Pokémon who battled bravely today! 
13,27,350,JESSIE,Hungry? Electivire bars to celebrate sweet victory! What else? JESSIE [
13,27,351,CONT'D],How about this? Empoleon innertubes! 
13,27,352,MEOWTH,"Miniature Ursaring, carved out of cool wood, and even cooler crash-resistant Hitmonlee helmets! "
13,27,353,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,27,354,GUY,I'd like an Electivire candy bar! 
13,27,355,GUY ,And I'd like an Empoleon innertube! 
13,27,356,WOMAN ,I'll take a miniature Ursaring please! 
13,27,357,JESSIE,Selling the customers things they want is an idea whose time has truly come! 
13,27,358,JAMES,We'll sell until we're tchotchke free! 
13,27,359,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",With big bonuses for you and me! 
13,27,360,BARRY,Paul! 
13,27,361,BARRY,Uh... 
13,27,362,BARRY,I lost. But I gave it my all- so I can honestly say right here I have no regrets... 
13,27,363,PAUL,It was a great battle. 
13,27,364,BARRY,"You think? Wow, that's awesome! So, let's battle again someday to see who's the world's top Trainer! "
13,27,365,PAUL,All right... 
13,27,366,BARRY,Ash? 
13,27,367,BARRY,"Wow, it seemed like the more I battled Paul, the more fired up I got! "
13,27,368,ASH,I know! Paul seems to get everyone feeling that way... 
13,27,369,BARRY,"If you go up against Paul, good luck! And, I'll be there in the stands cheering for both of you! "
13,27,370,ASH,Thanks! 
13,27,371,PIKACHU,[GRATEFUL] 
13,27,372,BROCK,"But before that, you're going to need to get through round three first! "
13,27,373,DAWN,"You never know what Conway's planning, so stay on your guard! "
13,27,374,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
13,27,375,"DAWN, PIPLUP, BROCK, ASH",[SCARED] 
13,27,376,CONWAY,"Remember, my ticket to victory is my secret strategy! "
13,27,377,"DAWN, PIPLUP",[AFRAID] 
13,27,378,ASH,Hey Conway! 
13,27,379,CONWAY,"And remember Ash, it's my secret strategy that's ultimately going to defeat you! "
13,27,380,ASH,"Don't count on it! I'm going to win it, and that's that! "
13,27,381,PIKACHU,[ANGRY] 
13,27,382,NARRATOR,"And so, what of Conway's secret strategy? And what will Ash's strategy be for winning the third round of the Sinnoh League Tournament? Stay tuned for all the answers"
13,26,0,NARRATOR,"The much-anticipated Sinnoh League tournament at Lily of the Valley Island is underway! And on the heels of a spectacular opening ceremony, the matchups for the first round have been revealed, with Ash squaring off against Nando! "
13,26,1,ASH,Battling Nando's got me so psyched! Isn't it awesome? 
13,26,2,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
13,26,3,NANDO,"Perhaps fate has a hand in our upcoming battle, Ash... "
13,26,4,ASH,"For sure, Nando! "
13,26,5,NANDO,"It was after meeting you that I decided to enter the Sinnoh League myself. And now, I get to battle you here! Yes, I'm truly honored... "
13,26,6,ASH,I'll give it everything I've got! No way you're going to b*at me! 
13,26,7,NANDO,"I'm looking forward to it. Good luck, Ash... "
13,26,8,ASH,"Yeah, you too! It's about you It's about me It's about hope It's about dreams It's about friends that work together To claim their destiny It's about reaching for the skies Pokemon! Given the courage And willing to try It's about never giving up So hold your head up And we will carry on... Sinnoh League Victors Pokemon! "
13,26,9,ASH,Okay...the first round is three-on-three... 
13,26,10,ASH,"Now, all my Pokémon are in top form...so which three am I going use? "
13,26,11,BROCK,"We know what Nando uses: Bug and Grass types! So, Ice, Fire, and Flying type moves will give you a good advantage! "
13,26,12,ASH,"Okay! So, that means I should choose from Glalie, Infernape, Staraptor or Swellow then, right? "
13,26,13,PIKACHU,[AGREE] 
13,26,14,DAWN,It's risky to say he only uses Bug and Grass types. Remember he used a Lopunny during the Grand Festival... 
13,26,15,ASH,"Yeah, that's right. I remember it now... "
13,26,16,DAWN,Ash...It's Paul... 
13,26,17,ASH,Hey Paul! Here we go! Already know which Pokémon you're using? 
13,26,18,PAUL,Of course... 
13,26,19,DAWN,I'll bet I know how you based your picks- on your opponent's strategy and type-advantage! 
13,26,20,PAUL,You bet right! I looked at the options and chose my three best Pokémon... 
13,26,21,ASH,Your three best...? 
13,26,22,BROCK,"Wow! You sound really confident, Paul! "
13,26,23,ASH,"I'm not going to lose either! I'm going to give it all I've got and win, so I can battle you in the finals! "
13,26,24,PIKACHU,[AGREEING] 
13,26,25,PAUL,You're pathetic... 
13,26,26,"ASH, BROCK, DAWN, PIKACHU",[SURPRISED] 
13,26,27,PAUL,Every Trainer competing here at the Sinnoh League has won eight Badges. Giving it all you've got means nothing! 
13,26,28,"ASH , PIKACHU",[ANNOYED] 
13,26,29,SELMA,The number you just drew will be the location of your shop. You take away your trash and don't hassle spectators or Trainers! 
13,26,30,SELMA,Think you can handle that...? 
13,26,31,SHOP KEEPERS ,Right! 
13,26,32,SELMA,"Remember, the success of the Sinnoh League is in our hands! That's the reason we're all here! Good luck to each and every one of you! "
13,26,33,SHOP KEEPERS ,Yeah! 
13,26,34,SELMA,"Now, my work here is done... "
13,26,35,JESSIE,Whose good luck? Using the lottery for shop locations is the unluckiest break that ever broke! 
13,26,36,JESSIE,"If we were any farther away from the action, we'd have to build our own airport! "
13,26,37,JAMES,That woman's the head honcho here so there's no use crying over failed capitalism... 
13,26,38,MEOWTH,"Instead of grousing, we'll use some Team Rocket elbow grease! "
13,26,39,JAMES,Of course! They'll shop 'til they drop and make ours thnumber one stop! 
13,26,40,JESSIE,"And while we're at it, we'll wait for the perfect point to pounce and then poach us a primo Pokémon! "
13,26,41,MEOWTH,"And until our primo Pokémon makes the scene, there's nothing wrong with padding our pockets with green! "
13,26,42,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,26,43,ASH,"Paul's right. Every Trainer here's got to be really good. So, I've got to come up with a strategy and a counter strategy before choosing any of my Pokémon. But...I'm sure Nando's already got an idea of what my strategy's going to be, so... But if I think of a counter strategy for that... No. Wait! Then Nando'll just... What am I talking about? "
13,26,44,PIKACHU,[CONFUSED] / [WORRIED] 
13,26,45,PIPLUP,[CONFUSED] 
13,26,46,DAWN,What's wrong? 
13,26,47,ASH,"Uh, it's nothing. Don't worry! Sorry I woke you up... "
13,26,48,ASH,Check it out! 
13,26,49,PIKACHU,[AWE] 
13,26,50,PIKACHU,[SURPRISED] 
13,26,51,ASH,"All of this time...I've battled side by side with my Pokémon, my friends... "
13,26,52,ASH,Training hard together... 
13,26,53,ASH,...cheering each other on... 
13,26,54,ASH,...and we won eight badges! 
13,26,55,ASH,That's it! 
13,26,56,ASH,All I have to do is believe in my Pokémon. That's my battle strategy! It's always been that way and always will be...! 
13,26,57,PIKACHU,[AGREE] 
13,26,58,ASH,Professor Oak made the transfer! Sorry for the hold up... 
13,26,59,PIKACHU,[HAPPY] 
13,26,60,DAWN,"So, which three Pokémon are you going to use against Nando, Ash? "
13,26,61,PIPLUP,[INTERESTED] 
13,26,62,ASH,It's a secret! You'll just have to wait until the battle starts! 
13,26,63,"ASH,DAWN, PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[SHOCK]

13,26,68,"ASH, PIKACHU",[GROANING] 
13,26,69,ASH,"Barry, what's your problem? "
13,26,70,BARRY,What's my problem? You bumped into me! But hey...there's no fine! 
13,26,71,BARRY,Because I'm psyched! I've just come up with an amazing three-Pokémon team! 
13,26,72,DAWN,"That good, huh? "
13,26,73,BARRY,"Better than good! No doubt, I'm winning today! Yup, and the whole tournament, too! "
13,26,74,ASH,The winner's going to be me! 
13,26,75,PIKACHU,[AGREEING] 
13,26,76,BARRY,Yeah? Dream on! I'm going to win it! Whoa! I can't be hanging out! I've got to get to my first match! Later! 
13,26,77,"ASH, PIKACHU",[SURPRISED] 
13,26,78,BROCK,Does Barry ever slow down? 
13,26,79,DAWN,An amazing team. Let's see...I wonder which three they are... 
13,26,80,CONWAY,"You know, I could tell you... "
13,26,81,"DAWN, PIPLUP",[SHOCKED] 
13,26,82,DAWN,No one makes an entrance like you... 
13,26,83,ASH,Conway? 
13,26,84,PIKACHU,[SURPRISE] 
13,26,85,CONWAY,You ought to know by now...I can answer every question you can think up! 
13,26,86,DAWN,"Uh, thanks but no thanks Conway. I'm good... "

13,26,88,"DAWN, BROCK, PIPLUP",[DISTURBED] 
13,26,89,SELMA,"Everyone's having a great time! And with this beautiful weather, we'll have one fantastic Sinnoh League! "
13,26,90,JESSIE,"So step right up and have a look, because this gourmet team knows how to cook! "
13,26,91,JAMES,Yummy Octillery snacks! Swablu cotton candy! Bronzor rice crackers and a Solrock bean bun only add to the fun! 
13,26,92,MEOWTH,"Take them all home to the family! It doesn't matter what the age is, this grub's what the latest rage is! "
13,26,93,WOBBUFFET,[ENTHUSASTIC AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,26,94,JESSIE,"Location, location, location! From now on I'm the head honcho around here! Time to relocate us a few customers... "
13,26,95,JESSIE,And who better for the task than dear Seviper? 
13,26,96,SEVIPER,[CONFUSED] 
13,26,97,JAMES,Cease! Customers won't have hungry tummies if they're being strong-armed! 
13,26,98,MEOWTH,Happy folks are hungry folks! 
13,26,99,JESSIE,So? Any bright ideas? 
13,26,100,JAMES,"Ideas...when it comes to quality, we have no peer! "
13,26,101,MEOWTH,Yeah! Have no fear! 
13,26,102,MEOWTH,Sometimes you've got to shake it up to make an honest living! And I know just how to swing it! 
13,26,103,WOBBUFFET,[HESITANT AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,26,104,MC,And he scores! 
13,26,105,MC,Which means Barry moves on to round two! 
13,26,106,BARRY,Yahoo! 
13,26,107,EMPOLEON,[EXCITED] 
13,26,108,BARRY,"Man, that was a piece of cake! And that means the whole Sinnoh League is ripe for the picking! "
13,26,109,BARRY,Hey! What in the world was all that about? 
13,26,110,MC,"And now! On the green field preparing to wage battle are our two opponents, Nando and Ash! "
13,26,111,BROCK,"Excellent! Ash's sure fired up! Confident, too... "
13,26,112,DAWN,"All right Ash, you can do it! "
13,26,113,PIPLUP,[CHEERING] 
13,26,114,MC,The time has come for our dueling Trainers to reveal their first Pokémon! 
13,26,115,NANDO,"All right, Roserade, let's go! "
13,26,116,ROSERADE,[APPEARING] 
13,26,117,ASH,"Staraptor, I choose you! "
13,26,118,STARAPTOR,[APPEARING] 
13,26,119,BROCK,"With Roserade battling Staraptor, looks like we had it right, didn't we? "
13,26,120,DAWN,"Well, there's no doubt Ash has the type advantage...! "
13,26,121,PIPLUP,[AGREEING] 
13,26,122,JUDGE,Nando will have the first move! All right! Go! 
13,26,123,NANDO,"All right, Roserade, use Sweet Scent! "
13,26,124,ROSERADE,[SWEET SCENT MOVE] 
13,26,125,ASH,"Quick, dodge it, Staraptor! "
13,26,126,STARAPTOR,[EXERTION] 
13,26,127,STARAPTOR,[GRUNTING] 
13,26,128,PIKACHU,[SCARED] 
13,26,129,MC,And Roserade's Sweet Scent has affected Staraptor's movement! 
13,26,130,NANDO,"And now, use Magical Leaf! "
13,26,131,ROSERADE,[MAGICAL LEAF MOVE]

13,26,144,NANDO,"Wait, but how? "
13,26,145,ASH,All right! Use Brave Bird!

13,26,147,ROSERADE,[YELP] 
13,26,148,STARAPTOR,[GROAN] 
13,26,149,NANDO,Roserade!

13,26,151,JUDGE,Roserade is unable to battle! The winner is Staraptor!

13,26,153,ASH,All right! 
13,26,154,PIKACHU,[HAPPY] 
13,26,155,DAWN,Way to go! 
13,26,156,PIPLUP,[HAPPY] 
13,26,157,NANDO,"Thanks, Roserade! You deserve a good rest... "
13,26,158,MC,So will Nando make a comeback? For his second Pokémon! 
13,26,159,NANDO,"Armaldo, you're next! "
13,26,160,ARMALDO,[APPEARING] 
13,26,161,"ASH, DAWN",Armaldo! 
13,26,162,POKEDEX,"Armaldo. The Plate Pokémon, and the evolved form of Anorith. After Anorith evolves into Armaldo, it proceeds to live on land and an armor-like shell surrounds its entire body. "
13,26,163,BROCK,It's going to be a tough battle against a Rock- and Bug-type... 
13,26,164,DAWN,"No need to worry! After all, he's totally got the momentum! "
13,26,165,PIPLUP,[ENCOURAGING] 
13,26,166,STARAPTOR,[TIRED] 
13,26,167,ASH,I know Staraptor's been hit several times...So we'll take the offense! Close Combat! 
13,26,168,STARAPTOR,[AGREE] 
13,26,169,NANDO,Protect! 
13,26,170,ARMALDO,[PROTECT MOVE] 
13,26,171,STARAPTOR,[SHOCK] 
13,26,172,STARAPTOR,[YELP] 
13,26,173,NANDO,Now use Rock Blast!

13,26,180,JUDGE,Staraptor is unable to battle! Armaldo's the winner! 
13,26,181,MC,And Nando makes a comeback in a fierce battle where neither side is backing down! 
13,26,182,BROCK,"Nando knew Staraptor's weak against Rock-type att*cks, so he simply made it part of his strategy. "
13,26,183,DAWN,"No need to worry! After all, the battle's just beginning! "
13,26,184,PIPLUP,[AGREEING] 
13,26,185,BARRY,"Man, oh man! Man, oh man! "
13,26,186,BROCK,"Hey, Barry, just relax...! "
13,26,187,BARRY,"Relax? No way, Brock! I saw the most incredible Trainer ever! "
13,26,188,BARRY,Talk about strong! This guy b*at all of his opponent's Pokémon just using his Darkrai and took the first match like it was nothing! 
13,26,189,BROCK,He's got a Darkrai? 
13,26,190,BARRY,"That's right! No one said that kind of Trainer would be here! Someone deserves a fine! Hey, don't you think so too, Dawn? "
13,26,191,DAWN,"Come on Ash, you can do it! "
13,26,192,PIPLUP,[ENCOURAGING] 
13,26,193,BARRY,How come you're not listening to me? What do you know! Ash's having a battle! 
13,26,194,BARRY,"Hey, hold on! It looks like Ash's losing out there! Hope he's okay! "
13,26,195,MC,"So, stand by for Ash's next Pokémon! "
13,26,196,ASH,"All right, Quilava, I choose you! "
13,26,197,QUILAVA,[APPEARING] 
13,26,198,ASH,"Now, time to show them the new stuff you can do! "
13,26,199,QUILAVA,[SHOWING OFF] 
13,26,200,NANDO,"Make sure you don't let your guard down, Armaldo. "
13,26,201,ARMALDO,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,26,202,MC,Now back to the action! It's a clash between Armaldo and Quilava! 
13,26,203,JESSIE,"Step right up, hungry hordes! Crackers and buns! What fun! "
13,26,204,JAMES,I've got Octillery snacks and Swablu cotton candy for really good eats! So how can you say no to these snacks? 
13,26,205,POCKET TEE GUY,"Uh, I really don't want any right now, thanks! "
13,26,206,MEOWTH,"Hey, don't be a shy guy! Because you decided to inv*de our sell space we're giving these babies away! What do you say? "
13,26,207,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,26,208,SWEATER GUY,Wait. Did you say you're giving those snacks away? 
13,26,209,JESSIE,That's right! Hungry and attentive! 
13,26,210,POCKET TEE GUY,Awesome! Thanks a lot! 
13,26,211,"JAMES, MEOWTH","Swell! Mangia, mangia! "
13,26,212,JAMES,Something's not adding up... 
13,26,213,JESSIE,As in the money we're losing by doing this! 
13,26,214,MEOWTH,Heh! Chill! Just dole it all out and give these lugs a thrill! 
13,26,215,JAMES,"Although it goes against my grain, I'll do what you say... "
13,26,216,JESSIE,No doubt these folks will have a nice day... 
13,26,217,JESSIE,"All right, g*ng! Who would like to try some Bronzor rice crackers? "
13,26,218,SELMA,Dear me! They're just giving away their merchandise! Now there's a weird concept! 
13,26,219,MC,And Quilava goes down! 
13,26,220,ASH,"Hang in there, Quilava! "
13,26,221,PIKACHU,[ENCOURAGING] 
13,26,222,QUILAVA,[STRUGGLING] 
13,26,223,MC,"But Armaldo is struggling as well! At this point, the match is impossible to call! "
13,26,224,NANDO,"Armaldo, use every ounce of energy you have and use X-Scissor! "
13,26,225,ARMALDO,[X-SCISSOR MOVE] 
13,26,226,ASH,"Quilava, Aerial Ace, let's go! "
13,26,227,QUILAVA,[AERIAL ACE]

13,26,232,QUILAVA,[GROAN] 
13,26,233,ASH,No! 
13,26,234,JUDGE,Both Pokémon are unable to battle! So! It's a draw! 
13,26,235,MC,A draw! Unbelievable! 
13,26,236,BARRY,They both have one Pokémon left! This is getting good! 
13,26,237,BROCK,I would think Nando will use Kricketune next...but I'm not sure about Ash. 
13,26,238,DAWN,"Yeah, me neither! I don't have a clue! "
13,26,239,CONWAY,Want to know what I think? 
13,26,240,BARRY,"Hey, who are you? "
13,26,241,CONWAY,Conway's the name... 
13,26,242,BARRY,Oh. Conway? 
13,26,243,CONWAY,"Yes, I happen to be the Trainer who's going to win the Sinnoh League! I did win the first round with flying colors... "
13,26,244,BARRY,"Well, my name's Barry from Twinleaf Town, and I'm going to win this thing! "
13,26,245,DAWN,Will you boys settle down? 
13,26,246,PIPLUP,[AGREEING] 
13,26,247,BARRY,"Uh, yes ma'am... "
13,26,248,MC,"Well both Trainers have only one Pokémon left! So the question is, which Pokémon will they use? "
13,26,249,NANDO,"Kricketune, take it away! "
13,26,250,KRICKETUNE,[APPEARING] 
13,26,251,ASH,"Heracross, I choose you! "
13,26,252,HERACROSS,[APPEARING] 
13,26,253,DAWN,Ash is using Heracross? 
13,26,254,PIPLUP,[SHOCKED] 
13,26,255,NANDO,Heracross versus another Bug-type like Kricketune. That Ash... What a fascinating choice! 
13,26,256,ASH,"All right! I want to see a head to head battle between those Bug-types! Heracross, let's give it all we've got so use Megahorn! "
13,26,257,HERACROSS,[MEGA HORN MOVE] 
13,26,258,NANDO,"Kricketune, Silver Wind! "
13,26,259,KRICKETUNE,[SILVER WIND MOVE] 
13,26,260,"KRICKETUNE, HERACROSS",[EXERT] 
13,26,261,HERACROSS,[EXERT] 
13,26,262,NANDO,"All right, Kricketune, use Sing... "
13,26,263,KRICKETUNE,[SING MOVE] 
13,26,264,HERACROSS,[SLEEPY] 
13,26,265,MC,"And because Kricketune used Sing, Heracross has fallen fast asleep! "
13,26,266,NANDO,"Kricketune, Fury Cutter! "
13,26,267,KRICKETUNE,[FURY CUTTER] 
13,26,268,ASH,"Heracross, use Sleep Talk! "
13,26,269,KRICKETUNE,[FURY CUTTER MOVE][FOCUS PUNCH MOVE] 
13,26,270,KRICKETUNE,[PAIN] 
13,26,271,BARRY,"Hey, that was Focus Punch! How'd Heracross do that in its sleep? "
13,26,272,CONWAY,"Well that's Sleep Talk. Even though a Pokémon's asleep, it randomly uses one of its moves. "
13,26,273,DAWN,"I'll bet Ash planned that out, didn't he? "
13,26,274,BROCK,Probably! It was smart for Heracross to learn Sleep Talk... 
13,26,275,NANDO,It's obvious Ash had a counter move against Kricketune's Sing in place... 
13,26,276,HERACROSS,[STARTING] 
13,26,277,ASH,"Heracross, use Focus Punch! "
13,26,278,HERACROSS,[AFFIRMATIVE]

13,26,280,NANDO,"Kricketune, dodge it! "

13,26,285,"KRICKETUNE, HERACROSS",[FURY CUTTER MOVE] 
13,26,286,ASH,Now this's the battle I've been waiting for! 
13,26,287,NANDO,Something strange has come over me...! 
13,26,288,NANDO,I've never experienced anything like this! This is the head-to-head battling Ash talked about! 
13,26,289,KRICKETUNE,[EXERTION] 
13,26,290,MC,It's now a clash of wills between Heracross and Kricketune! 
13,26,291,MC,So! Who's going down first? 
13,26,292,KRICKETUNE,[EXERTION] 
13,26,293,HERACROSS,[EXERTION] 
13,26,294,ASH,Heracross's going to run out of steam. I've got to get a move in! 
13,26,295,NANDO,Sing just might get countered with Sleep Talk... 
13,26,296,NANDO,"But still, that's Kricketune's... No... my Battling style! Now, Kricketune, use Sing! "
13,26,297,KRICKETUNE,[EXERTION] 
13,26,298,ASH,"Heracross, use Megahorn and aim for the ground! "
13,26,299,HERACROSS,[MEGAHORN MOVE]

13,26,307,NANDO,"Kricketune, No! "
13,26,308,KRICKETUNE,[DAZED] 
13,26,309,JUDGE,Kricketune is unable to battle! Heracross wins and that means that Ash from Pallet Town is our victor! 
13,26,310,MC,And the winner of this dazzling duel is none other than Ash! 
13,26,311,ASH,All right! 
13,26,312,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
13,26,313,HERACROSS,[EXCITED]

13,26,317,BROCK,And that was one suspenseful battle! 
13,26,318,BARRY,"Yeah, well, wait until my next battle! "
13,26,319,WOMAN,I hear you have really great Solrock bean buns! 
13,26,320,BLUE SHIRT GUY,"I'll take ten, no twenty Octillery snacks! "

13,24,40,BALTOY,[EXCITED] 
13,24,41,BUCK,You found it. Baltoy! Great!

13,24,43,ASH,Empty? 
13,24,44,BUCK,That's usually the case! So somebody got there before me. But that's why it's so exciting when I actually find something! 
13,24,45,BROCK,For sure! 
13,24,46,BUCK,"Okay... and here's where it gets interesting. There was no treasure, but there was this! "

13,24,55,BROCK,But the Pokégear says it's nothing but a forest. 
13,24,56,BUCK,"Nah, I'm sure of it! No doubt that's where the pirates hid their treasure! Although the part I'm not getting at all is why there are a bunch of Pokémon drawn all over this map. "
13,24,57,ASH,"Yeah. Voltorb, Pineco, Vileplume, and Graveler! "
13,24,58,BUCK,"You know, guys, if you're going to enter a big Pokémon tournament, then I'd think you know a whole bunch about Pokémon! Anybody? "

13,24,244,"PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[CURIOUS] 
13,24,245,BROCK,So that means the Solrock and Lunatone we saw on the map... 
13,24,246,DAWN,Represent these paintings on the ruins! 
13,24,247,BUCK,"Guys, up here! "
13,24,248,BUCK,Wait until you get a load of this! 
13,24,249,BROCK,Look at those patterns! 
13,24,250,BALTOY,[EXCITED] 
13,24,251,BUCK,"Baltoy, what's up? "
13,24,252,BALTOY,[EXCITED] 
13,24,253,ASH,"Whoa, what's this? "
13,24,254,BUCK,Think we're supposed to do something with this. 
13,24,255,BROCK,It could be another trap. 
13,24,256,BUCK,"Yeah, I know! "
13,24,257,BUCK,What was that? 
13,24,258,JESSIE,"Why, that's all us, all the time! "
13,24,259,JAMES,This is the way we swoop in sublime! - 
13,24,260,JESSIE,On the wind!  - 
13,24,261,JAMES,Past the stars! 
13,24,262,MEOWTH,In our prime! 
13,24,263,JESSIE,Bringing chaos at a breakneck pace! 
13,24,264,JAMES,"Dashing hope, putting fear in its place! "
13,24,265,JESSIE,A rose by any other name's just as sweet! 
13,24,266,JAMES,"When everything's worse, our work is complete! -"
13,24,267,JESSIE,Jessie!  -
13,24,268,JAMES,And James! 
13,24,269,MEOWTH,Meowth's the name! 
13,24,270,JESSIE,Putting you do-gooders in your place! 
13,24,271,JAMES,We're Team Rocket! 
13,24,272,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",In your face! 
13,24,273,JESSIE,No sense toiling over that treasure since it's ours already! 
13,24,274,BUCK,"You're nuts! We found it first, so it's ours! "
13,24,275,JAMES,"Second, fools! Team Rocket makes the treasure rules! "
13,24,276,MEOWTH,We're taking it while every one of you drools! 
13,24,277,ASH,No way we're letting you! 
13,24,278,DAWN,Get over it! 
13,24,279,MEOWTH,There's no Twerpie like a naive Twerpie... 
13,24,280,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",Oofah! 
13,24,281,CLAYDOL,[THREATENING] 
13,24,282,JAMES,Claydol! 
13,24,283,MEOWTH,Don't see them much! 
13,24,284,JESSIE,And worth oodles! 
13,24,285,ASH,That's the treasure? 
13,24,286,BUCK,Claydol? - 
13,24,287,DAWN,Hold on!  - 
13,24,288,BUCK,What's up? 
13,24,289,DAWN,Those patterns on the stones are the same patterns that are on Claydol! 
13,24,290,POKEDEX,"Claydol. The Clay Doll Pokémon, and the evolved form of Baltoy. Claydol is said to have come to life when an ancient doll made from clay was exposed to mysterious light. "
13,24,291,DAWN,Claydol must have something to do with this ruin! 
13,24,292,BUCK,I'll bet Claydol's guarding the treasure! 
13,24,293,JESSIE,We'll just fix that! Seviper! 
13,24,294,SEVIPER,[APPEARING] 
13,24,295,JAMES,"Carnivine, join the fray! "
13,24,296,JAMES,Excuse me! My head's frayed enough! Fray with the Twerps! 
13,24,297,JESSIE,"All right, Seviper! Poison Tail, presto! "
13,24,298,JAMES,"Carnivine, b*llet Seed! "
13,24,299,CLAYDOL,[EXERTION] 
13,24,300,CLAYDOL,[att*ck] 
13,24,301,JESSIE,Sometimes I get the feeling treasure is not to be in our future... 
13,24,302,JAMES,Falling prey to every prank a Pokémon can pull doesn't help! 
13,24,303,MEOWTH,At least you can't say we're not consistent! 
13,24,304,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",And blasting off again! 
13,24,305,DAWN,It's targeting us! 
13,24,306,PIPLUP,[BRAVE] 
13,24,307,DAWN,"Okay, Piplup, Bubble Beam! "
13,24,308,PIPLUP,[BUBBLE BEAM MOVE] 
13,24,309,CLAYDOL,[LIGHT SCREEN MOVE] 
13,24,310,BROCK,"Wow, that's Claydol's Light Screen! "
13,24,311,CLAYDOL,[att*ck] 
13,24,312,PIPLUP,[PAINED] 
13,24,313,DAWN,Piplup! 
13,24,314,CLAYDOL,[att*ck] 
13,24,315,ASH,It's strong! 
13,24,316,BUCK,It's not guarding the ruins for nothing! 
13,24,317,ASH,"Okay, Torterra! I choose you! "
13,24,318,TORTERRA,[APPEARING] 
13,24,319,CLAYDOL,[THREATENING] 
13,24,320,ASH,"Torterra, Leaf Storm, go! "
13,24,321,TORTERRA,[LEAF STORM MOVE] 
13,24,322,CLAYDOL,[att*ck] 
13,24,323,ASH,Energy Ball! 
13,24,324,TORTERRA,[ENERGY BALL MOVE] 
13,24,325,CLAYDOL,[EXERTION] 
13,24,326,ASH,Torterra can't stop it either! 
13,24,327,BUCK,Ash. I'll do it. 
13,24,328,BUCK,"Claydol evolved from a Baltoy, right? Maybe we'll be able to take care of this! All right, Baltoy, use Shadow Ball! "
13,24,329,BALTOY,[SHADOW BALL MOVE] 
13,24,330,BALTOY,[EXERTION] 
13,24,331,BALTOY,[PAINED] 
13,24,332,BUCK,Baltoy! Keep your guard up! 
13,24,333,BALTOY,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,24,334,BUCK,Now! Use Gyro Ball! 
13,24,335,BALTOY,[GYRO BALL MOVE] 
13,24,336,CLAYDOL,[CONFUSED] 
13,24,337,ASH,"Wow, Baltoy rocks! "
13,24,338,"DAWN, BROCK","Great, Baltoy! Yeah! "
13,24,339,"PIPLUP, PIKACHU",[CHEERING] 
13,24,340,BALTOY,[att*ck] 
13,24,341,CLAYDOL,[CONFUSED] 
13,24,342,BUCK,"Wow, when it comes to speed, Baltoy's much faster than Claydol! "
13,24,343,"CLAYDOL, BALTOY",[BATTLING] 
13,24,344,BUCK,"Baltoy, use Solar Beam! "
13,24,345,BALTOY,[SOLAR BEAM MOVE] 
13,24,346,CLAYDOL,[LIGHT SCREEN MOVE] 
13,24,347,CLAYDOL,[CONFUSED] 
13,24,348,BUCK,"Perfect! Baltoy, use Gyro Ball! "
13,24,349,CLAYDOL,[IMPACT] 
13,24,350,BUCK,Go! Poké Ball! 
13,24,351,BUCK,All right! 
13,24,352,BUCK,I did it! Finally! I've got a Claydol! 
13,24,353,"ASH, DAWN, BROCK, PIKACHU",Yeah! 
13,24,354,BROCK,Whoa! 
13,24,355,BUCK,Is that? 
13,24,356,DAWN,Could that be the treasure? 
13,24,357,BROCK,"Wow, Buck, that treasure map is obviously the real deal! "
13,24,358,ASH,Hold on. That's treasure? 
13,24,359,DAWN,"Yeah, where's all the gold and silver? "
13,24,360,BUCK,What are you guys talking about? This is the treasure! 
13,24,361,ASH,You've got to be kidding me. 
13,24,362,BUCK,"No! After I analyze the clay's components, I'll know which era it comes from! These are all museum-quality pieces! They're priceless treasures... from an archaeological point of view, of course! "
13,24,363,ASH,Archaeological? 
13,24,364,BUCK,"Yeah! You may not have guessed it by looking at me, but I want to become an archaeology professor someday! "
13,24,365,DAWN,Professor? No way! 
13,24,366,BUCK,"Way! I'll bet to you guys, these are nothing but weird pots! Look at this one! Amazing! I've never seen this shape before! "
13,24,367,BUCK,"Okay, guys! I'm getting on a different ferry. I've been hearing about treasure hidden somewhere up on Stark Mountain! "
13,24,368,DAWN,I hope you find it! 
13,24,369,BUCK,"No doubt about it. It's my thing! Hey, Ash... thanks for all the help you guys gave me. And good luck at the Sinnoh League! "
13,24,370,ASH,"Hey, thanks, Buck!  "
13,24,371,PIKACHU,[HAPPY] - 
13,24,372,ASH,"See you, Buck!  - "
13,24,373,DAWN,Bye! Take care! 
13,24,374,BROCK,Happy hunting! 
13,24,375,BROCK,"You're almost there, Ash. "
13,24,376,DAWN,You'll be in the Sinnoh League before you know it! 
13,24,377,ASH,"Hey, Pikachu, you ready to win it? "
13,24,378,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
13,24,379,NARRATOR,"It boggles the mind imagining all the Pokémon and battles awaiting Ash at the Sinnoh League, which only adds to the excitement! So be sure to stay tuned, as the journey continues"
13,23,0,ASH,Wow! 
13,23,1,ASH,Finally got them all! 
13,23,2,NARRATOR,"With his eighth badge safely in hand, Ash, along with our other heroes, is on his way to Lily of the Valley Island, site of the Sinnoh League! It's about you It's about me It's about hope It's about dreams It's about friends that work together To claim their destiny It's about reaching for the skies Pokemon! Given the courage And willing to try It's about never giving up So hold your head up And we will carry on... Sinnoh League Victors Pokemon! "
13,23,3,ASH,"Man, we just missed the ferry! "
13,23,4,PIKACHU,[SAD] 
13,23,5,DAWN,"Hey, I think maybe that's it out there! "
13,23,6,PIPLUP,[SAD] 
13,23,7,BROCK,"The next one's tomorrow morning, I'm afraid. "
13,23,8,ASH,Guess we'll have to hang here. 
13,23,9,DAWN,"Relax, no need to worry! There's lots of time! "
13,23,10,KENNY,"Floatzel, let's go! "
13,23,11,"DAWN, PIPLUP, BROCK, ASH, PIKACHU",[SURPRISED] 
13,23,12,FLOATZEL,[APPEARING] - 
13,23,13,DAWN,Kenny! - 
13,23,14,KENNY,Floatzel! Whirlpool! 
13,23,15,FLOATZEL,[WHIRLPOOL MOVE] 
13,23,16,KENNY,Now aim at the Whirlpool and use Aqua Jet! 
13,23,17,FLOATZEL,[AQUA JET MOVE] 
13,23,18,KENNY,What do you think? 
13,23,19,JASMINE,A Whirlpool and Aqua Jet combination! Now that's pretty good! That would multiply their strengths even in a normal battle! 
13,23,20,ASH,"Hey, look! "
13,23,21,BROCK,It's Jasmine! 
13,23,22,"DAWN, ASH, PIPLUP, PIKACHU",[CURIOUS] - 
13,23,23,DAWN,Jasmine? - 
13,23,24,ASH,"Yeah, Jasmine's the Leader over at the Olivine Gym! "
13,23,25,ASH,"Her partner, Steelix, is awesomely strong! "
13,23,26,BROCK,"It's been too long, Jasmine! "
13,23,27,JASMINE,"Hold on! Your name's Brock, isn't it? "
13,23,28,BROCK,Right! And meeting you again like this can only mean that fate has bound us together and frozen us as one in space and time forever! 
13,23,29,CROAGUNK,[CROAKING] 
13,23,30,BROCK,Or me... 
13,23,31,DAWN,"Hi, Kenny! - "
13,23,32,ASH,Jasmine! - 
13,23,33,KENNY,Dawn! 
13,23,34,JASMINE,"Wow, Ash, how are you doing? "
13,23,35,ASH,Great! 
13,23,36,PIKACHU,[GREETING] 
13,23,37,DAWN,I'm Dawn! Nice to meet you! 
13,23,38,JASMINE,Hello! I'm Jasmine! 
13,23,39,KENNY,"Hey, it's really too bad about the final round of the Grand Festival! "
13,23,40,DAWN,"Wow, so you were watching! "
13,23,41,KENNY,Of course I was! 
13,23,42,JESSIE,Those Twerps are too perky for their own good! 
13,23,43,MEOWTH,So? We've got to concentrate on getting Floatzel to the Boss! 
13,23,44,JAMES,That kind of strength demands no less! 
13,23,45,MEOWTH,Case in point: The Boss works his Boss fingers to the bone and needs a good night's sleep! 
13,23,46,MEOWTH,"But when the temperature's rising, the heat makes it impossible! "
13,23,47,MEOWTH,"And course, Floatzel can lower the temps by making the scene- now doesn't that feel keen? "
13,23,48,JAMES,You lost me on the hot weather super-strength connection. 
13,23,49,MEOWTH,"""I feel like a million bucks, thanks to my Floatzel mondo-cool thermal pillow! And for Meowth and friends giving me such a cool Pokémon, I think it would be quite cool to throw them some cool cash!"" "
13,23,50,MEOWTH,What a stash! 
13,23,51,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",What a way to b*at the heat! Cool and calm and rich! 
13,23,52,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,23,53,JAMES,"A plan would be cool, too. "
13,23,54,DAWN,"Wow, your Floatzel looks just great! "
13,23,55,KENNY,"Thanks! Yeah, I was just having Jasmine take a look at my Contest moves! "
13,23,56,ASH,"But Jasmine, you're the Olivine Gym Leader, so how does that work? "
13,23,57,BROCK,"Your specialty is normal Pokémon battles and not Contest Battles, right? "
13,23,58,JASMINE,"Right! But in order to really get stronger, I think it's best to learn from all kinds of experiences, and Contest Battles are teaching me a whole lot! "
13,23,59,ASH,But what about the Gym? 
13,23,60,JASMINE,"One of my colleagues is watching over the Gym for me. And thanks to him, I'm able to go out and really sharpen up my skills! "
13,23,61,BROCK,"That's wonderful, Jasmine! You're happy and proud to be a Gym Leader, while at the same time you're always looking for new ways to improve your battling skills! "
13,23,62,JASMINE,"Well, as far as I'm concerned, that's what a Gym Leader's all about! "
13,23,63,KENNY,"Dawn, so what's the plan from here on out? "
13,23,64,DAWN,Right now I'm going to go cheer Ash on at the Sinnoh League! 
13,23,65,KENNY,And after that? 
13,23,66,DAWN,After that? 
13,23,67,KENNY,"There's still lots of time before the next Grand Festival, so are you going to go back to Twinleaf Town for a while, or are you going to keep traveling on your journey instead? "
13,23,68,DAWN,I haven't really thought about it yet. 
13,23,69,KENNY,In that case... 
13,23,70,FLOATZEL,[SHOCKED] 
13,23,71,KENNY,Floatzel! 
13,23,72,JESSIE,Silly Twerps with heads filled with mush! 
13,23,73,JAMES,Get to the point! We're in a rush! - 
13,23,74,JESSIE,On the wind! - 
13,23,75,JAMES,Past the stars! 
13,23,76,MEOWTH,You Twerps are making me blush! 
13,23,77,KENNY,"Look! That's my Floatzel, Team Rocket! "
13,23,78,JESSIE,On whose show? 
13,23,79,MEOWTH,Yeah! Got to go! 
13,23,80,FLINT,Overheat! 
13,23,81,INFERNAPE,[OVERHEAT MOVE] 
13,23,82,JESSIE,"All right, who had the gall to sideswipe us on our way to the Boss's bank? "
13,23,83,JAMES,I already had untold millions spent in my mind's eye! 
13,23,84,MEOWTH,Shut up and fly! 
13,23,85,JESSIE,Wise guy! 
13,23,86,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",We're blasting off again! 
13,23,87,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,23,88,FLOATZEL,[EXERTION] 
13,23,89,KENNY,"Man, are you okay, Floatzel? "
13,23,90,FLOATZEL,[PLEASED] 
13,23,91,ASH,I know that Infernape! 
13,23,92,FLINT,"Right! And I'm sure glad I made it in time, Ash! "
13,23,93,INFERNAPE,[AGREEMENT] 
13,23,94,ASH,"Flint, what're you doing here? "
13,23,95,FLINT,"Well, I wanted to see you before you left to continue your journey! "
13,23,96,FLINT,"After all, you're the guy who brought my best buddy Volkner back to his old electrifying self! And that took some doing! "
13,23,97,ASH,Oh man... 
13,23,98,FLINT,"He wanted to come too, but he's busy taking on challengers, so he told me to give a big hello to all of you! "
13,23,99,JASMINE,"Hello, Flint! "
13,23,100,JASMINE,"My name's Jasmine, and I'm the Olivine Gym Leader! "
13,23,101,JASMINE,I'd like to challenge you to a Pokémon battle! 
13,23,102,FLINT,With me? 
13,23,103,JASMINE,One doesn't get a chance to have a battle with a member of the Elite Four every day! I'm sure it would help me grow a lot stronger! 
13,23,104,FLINT,Of course! Always happy to accept from a beautiful challenger! 
13,23,105,JASMINE,"Oh, thank you! "
13,23,106,ASH,A Gym Leader battling one of the Elite Four! Awesome! 
13,23,107,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
13,23,108,BROCK,The battle will be one-on-one! 
13,23,109,FLINT,I'm going to go with Infernape! 
13,23,110,INFERNAPE,[DETERMINED] 
13,23,111,JASMINE,Okay. Here's mine! 
13,23,112,STEELIX,[APPEARING] 
13,23,113,DAWN,Let me see. 
13,23,114,POKEDEX,"Steelix. The Iron Snake Pokémon, and the evolved form of Onix. Steelix's body is much harder than any metal, as it is tempered underground under high pressure and heat. "
13,23,115,ASH,"Yeah, Steelix's Iron Tail is really tough! "
13,23,116,PIKACHU,[AGREEMENT] 
13,23,117,DAWN,But a Steel type like Steelix is at a disadvantage against a Fire type like Infernape! 
13,23,118,ASH,"Yeah, but at the same time, Steelix is Jasmine's strongest partner! "
13,23,119,ASH,I wonder what her strategy to overcome that will be. 
13,23,120,ASH,Oh yeah! I should let my Infernape watch this! 
13,23,121,DAWN,That's a great idea! 
13,23,122,INFERNAPE,[APPEARING] 
13,23,123,ASH,"I want you to watch how Flint's Infernape handles a battle, okay? "
13,23,124,INFERNAPE,[EXCITED] 
13,23,125,DAWN,Something wrong? 
13,23,126,KENNY,"Nah! It's nothing. Jasmine, good luck! "
13,23,127,BROCK,Battle begin! 
13,23,128,FLINT,Why don't you go first? 
13,23,129,JASMINE,"Steelix! Iron Tail, let's go! "
13,23,130,STEELIX,[IRON TAIL MOVE] 
13,23,131,FLINT,"Dodge it, quick! "
13,23,132,INFERNAPE,[EXERTION] 
13,23,133,JASMINE,"Excellent! Infernape's been well trained! All right, Steelix, use Iron Tail, and aim well! "
13,23,134,STEELIX,[IRON TAIL MOVE] 
13,23,135,FLINT,Deflect it! 
13,23,136,INFERNAPE,[IMPACT] 
13,23,137,INFERNAPE,[SURPRISED] 
13,23,138,JASMINE,Use Sandstorm! 
13,23,139,STEELIX,[SANDSTORM MOVE] 
13,23,140,FLINT,Repel that! 
13,23,141,INFERNAPE,[STRUGGLING] 
13,23,142,ASH,It wiped out the Sandstorm! 
13,23,143,DAWN,It looks like none of Jasmine's att*cks seem to be working! 
13,23,144,ASH,Yeah! Of course that's Flint's battling style. 
13,23,145,DAWN,"So at first, Flint just holds back and watches to see how his opponent's going to att*ck! "
13,23,146,JASMINE,"Crunch, let's go! "
13,23,147,STEELIX,[CRUNCH MOVE] 
13,23,148,FLINT,Use Flare Blitz! 
13,23,149,INFERNAPE,[FLARE BLITZ MOVE] 
13,23,150,STEELIX,[IMPACT] 
13,23,151,STEELIX,[PAINED] 
13,23,152,JASMINE,Steelix! 
13,23,153,STEELIX,[STUNNED] 
13,23,154,ASH,"See that, Infernape? "
13,23,155,INFERNAPE,[EXCITED] 
13,23,156,BROCK,"Steelix is unable to battle! Infernape is the winner, and the victory goes to Flint! "
13,23,157,DAWN,"Wow, they won it in one move! "
13,23,158,ASH,Proves how amazing Flint really is! 
13,23,159,INFERNAPE,[IMPRESSED] 
13,23,160,JASMINE,You were wonderful! Now you take a good rest! 
13,23,161,FLINT,Infernape! Excellent job! 
13,23,162,FLINT,"I'm sorry, Jasmine! Letting my opponents have an easy go of it just isn't my style, you know? "
13,23,163,JASMINE,"I learned a lot more because of that! Thank you very much, Flint. "
13,23,164,KENNY,Dawn? 
13,23,165,KENNY,I'm going to go challenge Ash to a battle now. If I manage to win 
13,23,166,DAWN,Then what? 
13,23,167,KENNY,"Then, Dawn, I want you and I to go on a journey together! "
13,23,168,DAWN,Journey? 
13,23,169,KENNY,"I know this's out of nowhere, but I had to tell you how I feel! "
13,23,170,DAWN,"Hey, Kenny, wait! "
13,23,171,JASMINE,"So tell me, Flint, is the strategy of letting your opponents att*ck first like that your battling style? "
13,23,172,FLINT,"Right! See, for me, defense is the best way to train! Winning a battle without getting att*cked doesn't teach you anything! "
13,23,173,FLINT,"First I let my opponent att*ck, and then I defend against it, which helps me really sharpen up my skills! "
13,23,174,JASMINE,I see! 
13,23,175,FLINT,"But if my opponent's a whole lot stronger than me, then I can't really pull that off, of course! "
13,23,176,JASMINE,"Like, Cynthia, the Champion of the Elite Four? "
13,23,177,FLINT,Yeah! 
13,23,178,ASH,"Wow, Flint, are you planning on challenging Cynthia? "
13,23,179,FLINT,I am! But not until I've trained as hard as I possibly can and feel completely prepared! 
13,23,180,ASH,"Awesome! Man, would I love to see that battle! "
13,23,181,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
13,23,182,KENNY,Ash! 
13,23,183,KENNY,I challenge you to a battle! 
13,23,184,ASH,"Sure! I guess it's time to pick up where we left off, right? "
13,23,185,ASH,But let's pick it up tomorrow! I'm hungry! 
13,23,186,BROCK,"Hey, let's go back to the Pokémon Center! - Jasmine, care to join us? - "
13,23,187,JASMINE,Thanks! As long as it won't be any trouble for you all. 
13,23,188,BROCK,"No, no, no, you could never be any trouble! "
13,23,189,DAWN,Kenny! Come on! 
13,23,190,JASMINE,"Oh, you're so sweet. Thank you, Brock! "
13,23,191,ASH,"Boy, am I stuffed! "
13,23,192,TRAINER ,"Wow! Look, it's Flint! "
13,23,193,TRAINER ,"Hey, it is! It's Flint of the Elite Four! "
13,23,194,TRAINER ,Shake my hand! 
13,23,195,TRAINER ,Can I have your autograph? 
13,23,196,TRAINER ,Can I have a picture with you? 
13,23,197,FLINT,"Sure! Now, everybody, let's take turns! "
13,23,198,JASMINE,He is popular! 
13,23,199,DAWN,"Oh yeah, you're right "
13,23,200,JASMINE,Something on your mind? 
13,23,201,DAWN,"There is, though it's nothing really that important "
13,23,202,JASMINE,So tell me! 
13,23,203,DAWN,"You see, my goal is to become Top Coordinator, but now there are other things on my mind! "
13,23,204,DAWN,Right now it seems that all I can think about is cheering Ash on when he competes in the upcoming Sinnoh League! 
13,23,205,DAWN,And I can't really decide what I want to do after the Sinnoh League's over! 
13,23,206,JASMINE,I remember feeling like that before! I was wondering whether I should even continue as Gym Leader back then... 
13,23,207,JASMINE,"which is why I'm out on this journey right now! And since I've been on it, I've seen and heard so many interesting and important things, I can't even tell you! "
13,23,208,JASMINE,You have to decide for yourself what road is best for you to travel on! 
13,23,209,DAWN,For myself? 
13,23,210,JASMINE,"Dawn, in the end, only you can decide what kind of future you want! "
13,23,211,DAWN,Right! 
13,23,212,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
13,23,213,BROCK,Kenny! 
13,23,214,KENNY,Brock! What do you want? 
13,23,215,BROCK,I want you to let me tell you the true secret of love! 
13,23,216,KENNY,I'm not interested. Thanks. 
13,23,217,BROCK,A man keeps putting his heart out on the line! 
13,23,218,BROCK,"And then, it gets broken, and he puts it on the line again, and it gets broken again, and then again, and then again and again! "
13,23,219,BROCK,"And that, my friend, is the secret of love! "
13,23,220,KENNY,"Keep putting my heart on the line... You've given me hope! Thanks, Brock! "
13,23,221,TRAINERS,"Thanks a lot, Flint! Goodbye! - "
13,23,222,FLINT,Bye now! - 
13,23,223,ASH,"Hey, Flint? "
13,23,224,ASH,Please tell me about what it was like when you won the Sinnoh League. I can't tell you how much it would mean to me! 
13,23,225,FLINT,No problem! 
13,23,226,FLINT,It all happened back when I was around the same age you are right now... 
13,23,227,FLINT,Rumor had it my finals opponent was a really strong Trainer! 
13,23,228,YOUNG FLINT,"All right, Monferno, Flamethrower! "
13,23,229,MONFERNO,[FLAMETHROWER MOVE] 
13,23,230,COMPETITOR,Blow it out!

13,23,239,MONFERNO,[PAINED] 
13,23,240,YOUNG FLINT,"Monferno, hang in there! "
13,23,241,ASH,"Okay, Flint, so... how did you win? "
13,23,242,FLINT,You don't know? Because I'm a genius! 
13,23,243,ASH,"Hey! What kind of weird answer is that, anyway? "
13,23,244,PIKACHU,[OBJECTING] 
13,23,245,FLINT,It had nothing to do with theory or strategy. 
13,23,246,FLINT,"Look, Ash, as you get ready for the Sinnoh League, I've got one piece of advice for you. "
13,23,247,FLINT,"However strong your opponent may be...big deal! Only a person who truly believes they can win, can win! "
13,23,248,ASH,So I have to believe I can win! 
13,23,249,FLINT,Remember that! 
13,23,250,ASH,Right! 
13,23,251,KENNY,"Okay, Empoleon. So we're ready for tomorrow's battle with Ash, I want to polish the moves you already know until they shine! "

13,23,264,KENNY,Deflect it back! 
13,23,265,EMPOLEON,[EXERTION] 
13,23,266,ASH,"No! Buizel, are you okay? "
13,23,267,BUIZEL,[ANGRY] 
13,23,268,ASH,"No, forget it! It was my fault! "
13,23,269,EMPOLEON,[CHALLENGING] 
13,23,270,KENNY,"So you want to battle with that Buizel, don't you, Empoleon? "
13,23,271,EMPOLEON,[AGREEMENT] 
13,23,272,BUIZEL,[DETERMINED] 
13,23,273,ASH,Sounds like you want to have a battle with Empoleon!

13,23,275,KENNY,"Ash! If you don't mind, let's make our battle Empoleon versus Buizel! "
13,23,276,ASH,Sure! That sounds great! 
13,23,277,"EMPOLEON, BUIZEL",[CHALLENGING] 
13,23,278,BROCK,This will be a one-on-one Pokémon battle! 
13,23,279,KENNY,"Okay, here goes! "
13,23,280,EMPOLEON,[APPEARING] 
13,23,281,ASH,"Buizel, I choose you! "
13,23,282,DAWN,Empoleon and Buizel. A battle between two Water types! 
13,23,283,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
13,23,284,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
13,23,285,ASH,Buizel! Make sure you stay focused! 
13,23,286,BUIZEL,[DETERMINED] 
13,23,287,ASH,"Okay, Kenny! You go first! "

13,23,296,ASH,Intercept! 
13,23,297,BUIZEL,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,23,298,DAWN,"Wow, Ash is using Flint's battle style! "
13,23,299,"PIPLUP, PIKACHU",[CHEERING] 
13,23,300,ASH,And that's because battling is the highest form of training there is! I want Buizel's defense to look sharp! 
13,23,301,BUIZEL,[CONFIDENT] 
13,23,302,KENNY,Wonder if this'll work out like you planned! Use Hydro Cannon! 
13,23,303,EMPOLEON,[HYDRO CANNON MOVE] 
13,23,304,ASH,"Quick, intercept it with Water g*n! "
13,23,305,BUIZEL,[WATER g*n MOVE]

13,23,324,ASH,Buizel! 
13,23,325,BUIZEL,[STUNNED] 
13,23,326,BROCK,"Buizel is unable to battle! The winner is Empoleon, and the victory goes to Kenny! "
13,23,327,KENNY,"All right, Empoleon, we did it! "
13,23,328,EMPOLEON,[PROUD] 
13,23,329,ASH,"I'm sorry, Buizel! I guess I got a little carried away trying to battle too much like Flint! You deserve a good rest! "
13,23,330,BROCK,"That was great! Great training for you, as well... "
13,23,331,BROCK,"For someone who's been training as long as you have, sometimes your worst enemy can be overconfidence! "
13,23,332,ASH,Yeah! 
13,23,333,PIKACHU,[HAPPY] 
13,23,334,KENNY,"Hey, Dawn... "
13,23,335,DAWN,"Wow, Kenny, great job! "
13,23,336,KENNY,"So look, Dawn I'll be over at the lighthouse. If you want to come on a journey with me, I'll be waiting there. "
13,23,337,DAWN,Kenny... 
13,23,338,ASH,"So what're you going to do now, Jasmine? "
13,23,339,JASMINE,"It's back to the Olivine Gym! From this moment on, my goal is to get even stronger battling as a Gym Leader! "
13,23,340,FLINT,"Wants to get stronger, huh? Ash, I've decided that I'm going to go ahead and challenge Cynthia now! "
13,23,341,ASH,"Whoa, really? "
13,23,342,FLINT,Remember that bit of advice I gave you? 
13,23,343,ASH,"Sure! That only a person who really believes they can win, can win! "
13,23,344,FLINT,"To tell the truth, Ash, I didn't really believe  percent I could even defeat Cynthia! As long as I didn't believe I could win, there was no way I could b*at her. Now I feel I'm finally ready to go! "
13,23,345,ASH,"Great, Flint! And you can be sure I'll be rooting for you all the way! - "
13,23,346,BROCK,"Me, too! - "
13,23,347,JASMINE,And me! 
13,23,348,FLINT,"Wow, thank you all! "
13,23,349,FLINT,Take good care! 
13,23,350,JASMINE,Good to see you! 
13,23,351,ASH,Thanks! Lots of luck with everything you guys are up to! 
13,23,352,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
13,23,353,KENNY,Guess Dawn's not coming... 
13,23,354,KENNY,What's this? 
13,23,355,KENNY,Dear Kenny... 
13,23,356,DAWN,"About my future plans... For the time being, I've decided to go with Ash and cheer him on at the Sinnoh League! I'll have to think about what I'm doing after that, and only I can figure that out! "
13,23,357,DAWN,"But I can guarantee you one thing for sure: no matter what else happens, I'm going to keep on working toward my dream of being Top Coordinator! "
13,23,358,DAWN,"And as long as we share that dream, Kenny, I'm certain we'll meet again! Count on it! "
13,23,359,DAWN,Kenny! 
13,23,360,DAWN,Kenny! 
13,23,361,KENNY,"Hey, Dawn! "
13,23,362,DAWN,"Now make sure you take good care of yourself, Kenny, and let's both give it everything we've got! "
13,23,363,KENNY,"I'm going to be heading out on my own journey, Dawn, and you know I'll be out there doing my best every day! And that means you can count on the fact that we'll meet again! "
13,23,364,DAWN,"P.S. I have to admit, and I hope you don't mind... you looked kind of handsome when you b*at Ash! "
13,23,365,ASH,"Brock, where'd Dawn go? "
13,23,366,DAWN,Right here! 
13,23,367,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
13,23,368,ASH,"Hey! Where were you, anyway? "
13,23,369,DAWN,"Oh, just staring at the beautiful sea. "
13,23,370,BROCK,"Kenny, good luck! "
13,23,371,JAMES,"So, where are they pointing their little pointy Twerpish heads this time? "
13,23,372,JESSIE,"Who cares? Does it really matter? Wherever Twerps travel, Team Rocket will follow in their wake! "
13,23,373,MEOWTH,"And we'll be on them like white on rice until we've got a Pikachu in our pocket, along with tons of dough-re-mi! "
13,23,374,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,23,375,BROCK,We'll be getting to Lily of the Valley Island soon! 
13,23,376,DAWN,And I'll be cheering for you to win the Sinnoh League! 
13,23,377,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
13,23,378,ASH,Thanks! And that means I'm winning for sure! 
13,23,379,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
13,23,380,NARRATOR,"And so, as Kenny embarks upon a brand-new journey, Jasmine returns as Gym Leader of the Olivine Gym, and Flint heads off to challenge Cynthia "
13,23,381,NARRATOR,"our heroes sail off to Lily of the Valley Island, while Ash prepares to challenge the Sinnoh League! Good friends all, as the adventure continues"
13,22,0,NARRATOR,"With Ash's eighth Gym badge and entry into the Sinnoh League on the line, Ash now challenges Volkner once again! But will he be victorious and win the coveted Beacon Badge? "
13,22,1,DAWN,"Okay! Since Ash cheered for me at the Grand Festival, it's time to return the favor and cheer for him as hard as I can! "
13,22,2,BUNEARY,[AGREEMENT] 
13,22,3,DAWN,"Do it, do it, fight fight fight! Come on, Ash, and do it right! Show us just how great you are! You can do it! You're a star! Yeah! "
13,22,4,VOLKNER,"Welcome back! Today's a great day for a battle. So let's give it all we've got, agreed? "
13,22,5,ASH,Of course! I'm really looking forward to it! 
13,22,6,REFEREE MECH,"The Sunyshore Gym battle between Volkner, the Gym Leader, and Ash, the challenger, will now begin! It will be a three-on-three battle, "
13,22,7,REFEREE MECH ,"and the battle will be over when all three Pokémon on either side are unable to continue! Furthermore, only the challenger is allowed to substitute Pokémon! "
13,22,8,FLINT,"Word's getting around that Volkner's back, and challengers are lining up to battle him.but Volkner promised his first opponent was going to be Ash. There's no doubt Volkner's really fired up, especially after his last battle against Ash was called off after all that craziness went down! "
13,22,9,FLINT,Can't wait! 
13,22,10,ASH,"I'm going to get my eighth badge, no matter what! "
13,22,11,PIKACHU,[DETERMINED] It's about you It's about me It's about hope It's about dreams It's about friends that work together To claim their destiny It's about reaching for the skies Pokemon! Given the courage And willing to try It's about never giving up So hold your head up And we will carry on... Sinnoh League Victors Pokemon! 
13,22,12,JESSIE,"We may have come up short stealing Sunyshore Tower once before, but today we're going to right that wrong and give that slick solar-powered system to the Boss as a green gift! "
13,22,13,JAMES,I happen to know that tower like the back of my glove! 
13,22,14,MEOWTH,Kind of like finding a lost branch from the family tree. 
13,22,15,REFEREE MECH,"Battle, begin! "
13,22,16,VOLKNER,"Hope you're ready, Ash! Because here's my first Pokémon! Go! "
13,22,17,ELECTIVIRE,[APPEARING] 
13,22,18,ASH,"It's an Electivire! All right.Torterra, I choose you! "
13,22,19,TORTERRA,[APPEARING] 
13,22,20,DAWN,"There's a team worth cheering for! Go, team, go! "
13,22,21,BROCK,"A Grass- and Ground-type Pokémon like Torterra has a definite advantage against Electivire, who's an Electric type. "
13,22,22,FLINT,"You're right, but Volkner's not going to be that easy to b*at! "
13,22,23,ASH,"All right, Torterra, use Leaf Storm! "
13,22,24,TORTERRA,[LEAF STORM MOVE] 
13,22,25,VOLKNER,"Quick, Electivire, use Fire Punch! "
13,22,26,ELECTIVIRE,[FIRE PUNCH MOVE] 
13,22,27,DAWN,How's Electivire blocking Leaf Storm with Fire Punch? 
13,22,28,BROCK,Whoa! Now that's Gym Leader strategy! Volkner's skillfully using an att*ck move as a defense move! 
13,22,29,FLINT,"Yeah, and he's just getting started. "
13,22,30,DAWN,Imagine having a strategy in place to battle against a Pokémon that has a type advantage over his. 
13,22,31,ASH,"Man, Volkner's good! I'm impressed! All right then, Torterra, use Leaf Storm one more time! "
13,22,32,TORTERRA,[LEAF STORM MOVE] 
13,22,33,VOLKNER,"Electivire, Fire Punch! "
13,22,34,ELECTIVIRE,[FIRE PUNCH MOVE] 
13,22,35,ASH,"Energy Ball, let's go!  "
13,22,36,TORTERRA,[ENERGY BALL MOVE] 
13,22,37,ELECTIVIRE,[IMPACT] 
13,22,38,VOLKNER,"Well, well! "
13,22,39,ASH,Torterra! Use Rock Climb! 
13,22,40,TORTERRA,[ROCK CLIMB MOVE] 
13,22,41,ELECTIVIRE,[NERVOUS] 
13,22,42,TORTERRA,[DETERMINED] 
13,22,43,BROCK,They're going for it in one move! 
13,22,44,ELECTIVIRE,[NERVOUS] 
13,22,45,VOLKNER,"All right, Electivire, use Ice Punch! "
13,22,46,ELECTIVIRE,[ICE PUNCH MOVE] 
13,22,47,TORTERRA,[IMPACT] 
13,22,48,ASH,What? 
13,22,49,TORTERRA,[STUNNED] 
13,22,50,REFEREE MECH,Torterra is unable to battle! Electivire's the winner! 
13,22,51,BROCK,"Wow, I'll bet Volkner had Electivire learn Ice Punch as a counter-strategy against Ground-type Pokémon, you know? "
13,22,52,FLINT,"Well, he's the Gym Leader, after all. Winning against Volkner is no walk in the park, for sure. And just watching this battle has gotten me completely pumped up! "
13,22,53,VOLKNER,"Ash, the transition you made from Leaf Storm to Energy Ball was really well done. "
13,22,54,VOLKNER,"It's like I can feel your spark! Wow, I'm thoroughly enjoying our battle. "
13,22,55,ASH,"Torterra, return! You deserve a really good rest. Pikachu, you ready to go? "
13,22,56,PIKACHU,[CONFIDENT] 
13,22,57,JESSIE,I hate doors with an attitude! 
13,22,58,JAMES,"If it's glued, I want to buy stock in that glue! "
13,22,59,MEOWTH,Maybe it'll open in this century! 
13,22,60,JAMES,Said security system annoys me to no end! 
13,22,61,JESSIE,The nerve! And after we got in last time without a hitch! 
13,22,62,MEOWTH,"Of course, we're probably why they changed it. "
13,22,63,JESSIE,There's a big duh. 
13,22,64,ASH,"Now, Pikachu, use Quick att*ck! "
13,22,65,PIKACHU,[QUICK att*ck MOVE] 
13,22,66,VOLKNER,Dodge it!  
13,22,67,ELECTIVIRE,[EXERTION]

13,22,82,FLINT,Of course! That's Electivire's Ability. 
13,22,83,BROCK,"Ability? Wow, that's Motor Drive, isn't it? It neutralizes its opponent's Electric-type moves! That's why it's not taking damage! "
13,22,84,PIKACHU,[EXERTION] 
13,22,85,ASH,"Okay! It'll be all right.Electric-type moves may have no effect, but if we can get close enough and use Iron Tail. "

13,22,138,JOLTEON,[APPEARING]

13,22,172,FLINT,"Oh, wow! Ash is really good! "
13,22,173,DAWN,All right! Now the score is Ash: two to one! 
13,22,174,JESSIE,"If I'm going to get my hair done, I don't want a perm! "
13,22,175,JAMES,"Is it me, or am I noticing subtle décor changes? "
13,22,176,MEOWTH,"Anyone doing major renovation's going to want to spruce things up a bit at the same time, so why don't we go hit the deck and rev this baby up? "
13,22,177,JAMES,That's the last thing he'd expect us to do! 
13,22,178,VOLKNER,"So who would've ever thought I'd be on my third Pokémon by now? Luxray, let's go! "

13,22,184,VOLKNER,I see! Using Pikachu again! 
13,22,185,FLINT,Maybe that battle with Electivire gave Ash a confidence boost! 
13,22,186,ASH,"All right, Pikachu, use Quick att*ck! "
13,22,187,PIKACHU,[QUICK att*ck MOVE]

13,22,192,BROCK,Shock Wave's not supposed to be very effective against Pikachu! 
13,22,193,FLINT,Not here! It's in a league of its own. 
13,22,194,ASH,"Pikachu, Iron Tail, let's go! "

13,22,221,JESSIE,"Well, no one's flying anything from here! "
13,22,222,JAMES,Looks more like the generator room! 
13,22,223,MEOWTH,"Man! If you stay away long enough, it gets really hard to recognize the neighborhood! "
13,22,224,JESSIE,"All right, let's move out! "
13,22,225,JAMES,Seems someone has a fondness for gluing doors! 
13,22,226,JESSIE,Whaaat?! 
13,22,227,VOLKNER,"Well, this is it! Whether I win or lose, Ash, it's sad to think this will be our last battle... "
13,22,228,ASH,I hear you! And I'm giving it my all! 
13,22,229,VOLKNER,And I would expect nothing less! 
13,22,230,FLINT,"Ash has battled really well, especially against an - expert like Volkner!  - "

13,22,246,BROCK,"So Infernape's Flamethrower's countered by Luxray's Shock Wave, then Infernape's Mach Punch is made ineffective by Luxray's Double Team! "
13,22,247,FLINT,"And on top of that, Luxray was able to att*ck Infernape with Thunder Fang at close range! "
13,22,248,FLINT,That's Volkner when he means business! 
13,22,249,VOLKNER,Luxray! Use Shock Wave!

13,22,271,JESSIE,"I'm no gambler, so why did you two listen to me? "

13,22,273,MEOWTH,This is the kind of light show I can totally do without! 
13,22,274,JESSIE,It's cheaper than a beauty parlor. 
13,22,275,JAMES,My appointment's not until next week! 
13,22,276,MEOWTH,"Well, I just made you both appointments for the rubber room. "

13,21,14,JESSIE,"Seviper, Wobbuffet, return! "
13,21,15,JESSIE,We've misplaced Meowth! 
13,21,16,JAMES,"Perhaps, though we were on the same flight... "
13,21,17,JESSIE,AWOL! 
13,21,18,GLAMEOW,[CURIOUS] 
13,21,19,MAMIE,"Do you see something, Glameow? "
13,21,20,GLAMEOW,[EXCITED] 
13,21,21,MAMIE,"Oh no, that poor Meowth! "
13,21,22,MAMIE,Meowth should be just fine after that medicine and a good rest! 
13,21,23,MEOWTH,Yipes! I'm hallucinating loveliness! 
13,21,24,MAMIE,Wonderful! You're awake! 
13,21,25,MEOWTH,Awake but clueless... what happened? 
13,21,26,MAMIE,"Glameow and I found you lying up on the mountain, so we brought you here and took care of you! "
13,21,27,MEOWTH,Yeah? 
13,21,28,GLAMEOW,[PROUD] 
13,21,29,MEOWTH,So you two saved me! 
13,21,30,MAMIE,I can't believe it! You can talk! How rare is that? 
13,21,31,MEOWTH,It's a gift! What can I say? 
13,21,32,MAMIE,I'm certain we'd both love it if you'd have lunch with us... 
13,21,33,MEOWTH,I'm all over that! 
13,21,34,MEOWTH,"Man oh man...great grub, a gorgeous Glameow to do the brunch thing with... I think I've hit the Meowth motherlode! "
13,21,35,MEOWTH,I brushed against her delicate paw! It's so...so... 
13,21,36,GLAMEOW,[SURPRISED] / [PLEASED] 
13,21,37,MEOWTH,Sweet! 
13,21,38,JAMES,"Meowth, old chum! "
13,21,39,JESSIE,"Location, please! "
13,21,40,MEOWTH,Guys! I'm hanging over here! 
13,21,41,JAMES,Behind you! 
13,21,42,JESSIE,Your own search and recovery! 
13,21,43,JAMES,Thank you so much for assisting our diminutive cohort! Your generosity knows no bounds... 
13,21,44,JAMES,I would recommend you take a tip from our playbook and thank them yourself! 
13,21,45,GLAMEOW,[FAREWELL] 
13,21,46,"JESSIE, JAMES","Off we go, then! "
13,21,47,JAMES,We as in you! 
13,21,48,JESSIE,Andele! 
13,21,49,MEOWTH,"No, no, no, no... wait... Glameow, say it ain't so! "
13,21,50,MEOWTH,Everything I think I see looks like that doll Glameow to me... 
13,21,51,JAMES,What? Traumatized travel sickness? 
13,21,52,JESSIE,Snap out of it and start strategizing! 
13,21,53,MEOWTH,I got it! The Meowthian brainstorm of the century! 
13,21,54,JESSIE,Do tell! 
13,21,55,MEOWTH,We need to catch that Glameow! 
13,21,56,JAMES,But Pikachu's always been our brass ring. 
13,21,57,JESSIE,Why would we do such a silly thing? 
13,21,58,MEOWTH,"Not silly, genius! Get a load... "
13,21,59,MEOWTH,We'll have the most grateful Boss for gifting him that Glameow! Wow! 
13,21,60,JAMES,"Clarify, please... "
13,21,61,MEOWTH,"When the Boss comes out of slumberland in the morning, there'll be Glameow with that gorgeous grin! "
13,21,62,MEOWTH,It'll be like he's got his own personal sun shining right there in his room. His heart will sing while his spirits zoom! 
13,21,63,JAMES,All for a singing heart? 
13,21,64,MEOWTH,Yo! Sometimes it's the simple things in life that rock! 
13,21,65,JESSIE,"Well, since our strategy sack is empty, we might as well go with Operation Grab Glameow... "
13,21,66,MEOWTH,"Oh, it'll be a beaut, and how! "
13,21,67,PIKACHU,[ALERT] 
13,21,68,"BROCK, ASH, DAWN, PIPLUP",[SURPRISED] 
13,21,69,GLAMEOW,[ALERT] 
13,21,70,MAMIE,"Oh, look! It's a Pikachu and a Piplup, too! "
13,21,71,DAWN,Hello there! 
13,21,72,ASH,Hi! I'm Ash. 
13,21,73,DAWN,And my name is Dawn! 
13,21,74,BROCK,Hi! I'm Brock. 
13,21,75,PIKACHU,[GREETING] 
13,21,76,GLAMEOW,[GREETING] 
13,21,77,MAMIE,Hi! My name's Mamie. I'm out on a Gym battle journey! 
13,21,78,ASH,Awesome! 
13,21,79,MAMIE,"But, to be totally honest, I haven't been able to win a single Gym badge so far... "
13,21,80,DAWN,So you just started your journey! 
13,21,81,MAMIE,"Yeah. I just challenged the Pastoria Gym, but I lost. "
13,21,82,ASH,I know that Gym! That's Crasher Wake's Gym! 
13,21,83,BROCK,Don't worry! You'll start winning once you get a bit more experience! 
13,21,84,DAWN,"Right! Mamie, there's no need to worry! "
13,21,85,MAMIE,"That's such a relief to hear you all say that, and thank you! "
13,21,86,"ASH, PIKACHU, DAWN, BROCK, MAMIE, GLAMEOW",[SHOCKED]

13,21,88,"ASH, DAWN, BROCK, MAMIE, PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[PAINED] 
13,21,89,DAWN,Who would go and put a cage right here? 
13,21,90,ASH,"Yeah, I wonder! "
13,21,91,JESSIE,"Ah, the wonderment of a child! "
13,21,92,JAMES,"For a Twerp, thinking at all is wild! "
13,21,93,JESSIE,On the wind! 
13,21,94,JAMES,Past the stars! 
13,21,95,MEOWTH,You're not getting me riled! 
13,21,96,GLAMEOW,[SCARED] 
13,21,97,JESSIE,Glameow gloriously grabbed! 
13,21,98,MAMIE,"No! Those bad people have stolen my little Glameow! Glameow, return, quick! "
13,21,99,MEOWTH,Hey! That's mine! 
13,21,100,JAMES,"Carnivine, assist! "
13,21,101,CARNIVINE,[AFFECTIONATE] 
13,21,102,JAMES,Cease and desist! 
13,21,103,ASH,Buizel! I choose you! 
13,21,104,BUIZEL,[APPEARING] 
13,21,105,CARNIVINE,[EXERTION] 
13,21,106,ASH,"Quick, Buizel, use Aqua Jet! "
13,21,107,BUIZEL,[AQUA JET MOVE] 
13,21,108,JAMES,"Carnivine, use b*llet Seed! "
13,21,109,CARNIVINE,[b*llet SEED MOVE] 
13,21,110,MAMIE,What's this all about? 
13,21,111,DAWN,"Mamie, don't let go, please! "
13,21,112,MEOWTH,Those Twerps never listen! 
13,21,113,JAMES,"Well done! Carnivine, return! "
13,21,114,"BROCK, MAMIE, ASH, PIPLUP, PIKACHU",[SHOCKED] 
13,21,115,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH","Ciao, chumps! "

13,21,117,"ASH, BROCK, DAWN, MAMIE, PIPLUP, PIKACHU",[SCARED] 
13,21,118,ASH,Man! Those guys are the worst you can get! 
13,21,119,DAWN,"That's for sure! Mamie, are you all right? "
13,21,120,MAMIE,"I'm fine, but Glameow's gone! Now what am I going to do? "
13,21,121,BROCK,That Team Rocket! 
13,21,122,ASH,"Hey, no sweat! We'll get your Glameow back, I promise! "
13,21,123,PIKACHU,[DETERMINED] 
13,21,124,PIPLUP,[DETERMINED] 
13,21,125,JESSIE,So far your strategy is paying off in spades! 
13,21,126,JAMES,A victory worth savoring! Catching the Twerps off guard with an under-the-bridge booby trap is one of the great joys in life! 
13,21,127,JESSIE,Traps are what we do best! And what those Twerps do worst! 
13,21,128,MEOWTH,That works for me... 
13,21,129,JESSIE,"So? The sooner the Boss receives, the better for us! "
13,21,130,MEOWTH,"Don't be too hasty! Great strategies can sure take it out of you, you know? "
13,21,131,JAMES,"Oh, perhaps. A nice rest might be just the thing! "
13,21,132,JESSIE,It has a nice ring. 
13,21,133,MEOWTH,"Wait! Let me take that heavy Poké Ball off of your hands, okay? "
13,21,134,JESSIE,"It's a Poké Ball, not a bowling ball... "
13,21,135,STARAPTOR,[CALLING] 
13,21,136,ASH,Staraptor! See anything? 
13,21,137,STARAPTOR,[DISAPPOINTED] 
13,21,138,ASH,"Well, I know you did your best... Thanks, Staraptor! Return! "
13,21,139,TOGEKISS,[CALLING] 
13,21,140,DAWN,"Togekiss, were you able to locate Team Rocket? "
13,21,141,TOGEKISS,[DISAPPOINTED] 
13,21,142,DAWN,Thanks! I really appreciate you trying. Return! 
13,21,143,BROCK,I think we all need rest. Let's pick it up tomorrow. 
13,21,144,ASH,Okay. 
13,21,145,MAMIE,"Dear Glameow... Please, please be okay... "
13,21,146,MEOWTH,"There you are, doll! "
13,21,147,MEOWTH,"Okay, gorgeous Glameow, come on out! "
13,21,148,GLAMEOW,[APPEARING] 
13,21,149,MEOWTH,"Wow, what a looker! "
13,21,150,GLAMEOW,[CURIOUS] 
13,21,151,MEOWTH,"Hey, what are you talking about, ""What happened to my Trainer?"" We've got other stuff to worry about! "
13,21,152,GLAMEOW,[CONFUSED] 
13,21,153,MEOWTH,"What do you mean ""What do I mean""? Look, here's the lowdown! Those two sleeping beauties over there are Jessie and James, and they're really bad eggs! "
13,21,154,GLAMEOW,[CURIOUS] 
13,21,155,MEOWTH,"Yeah! They forced me to catch you, dig? But you don't want to hang out with them! "
13,21,156,"INFERNAPE, SEVIPER",[BATTLING] 
13,21,157,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH, SEVIPER, GLAMEOW",[PAINED] 
13,21,158,MEOWTH,"When we have a blastoff, it ain't no blast! "
13,21,159,MEOWTH,You're going to end up flying much more then you ever bargained for! 
13,21,160,MEOWTH,I don't want anything bogus happening to you! 
13,21,161,MEOWTH,And that's why I'm trying to get you out of this mess! 
13,21,162,GLAMEOW,[SUSPICIOUS] 
13,21,163,MEOWTH,"Wait, ""am I on the level""? Of course! See, I'm like your personal Poké-knight in shining armor, Rapidashing in to save the beautiful princess! "
13,21,164,GLAMEOW,[CONFUSED] 
13,21,165,GLAMEOW,[SURPRISED] 
13,21,166,MEOWTH,"You can take that fantasy with a grain of salt, but not the fact that I really want to help you out! "
13,21,167,GLAMEOW,[CURIOUS] 
13,21,168,MEOWTH,"Whoa. You're cutting me to the quick! A Pokémon's life's a whole lot more then battling for the Trainers, you know! If you stick with me, I promise I'll treat you to the kind of lush life a total cutiepie like you deserves! "
13,21,169,GLAMEOW,[UNSURE] 
13,21,170,MEOWTH,I wouldn't ever lie about affairs of the heart! It's part and parcel of a Meowth's code! 
13,21,171,GLAMEOW,[QUESTIONING] 
13,21,172,MEOWTH,You and me a team? I am so there! I promise I'll spend every waking hour making you happy! Your battling days are over! 
13,21,173,GLAMEOW,[OBJECTING] 
13,21,174,MEOWTH,"Oh... So you like battles, huh? Then battle to your heart's content! Because if your heart's content, then my heart's content! "
13,21,175,GLAMEOW,[AGREEMENT] 
13,21,176,MEOWTH,"Kid, stick with me, and I'll give you a life free of stress, stupid stuff, and strife! I can whip up some mean Pokémon food, and I even do dishes! "
13,21,177,MEOWTH,[SUSPICIOUS] 
13,21,178,MEOWTH,"Hey, I'm telling you the truth! Totally straight up! Long as you got me, you're going to be happy, you'll see! "
13,21,179,GLAMEOW,[UNSURE] 
13,21,180,MEOWTH,A cozy boat in the moonlight! The perfect size for a Meowth and his mate! 
13,21,181,GLAMEOW,[UNSURE] 
13,21,182,MEOWTH,"We can let the rest of this crazy world go by, while we float gently down the stream of love and happiness! Check it out... "
13,21,183,MEOWTH,"If the moon were smiling any bigger, it'd be laughing out loud, it's so tickled for us! "
13,21,184,ASH,"Staraptor, try looking for Team Rocket again! "
13,21,185,STARAPTOR,[APPEARING] 
13,21,186,DAWN,"Try again, too, Togekiss! Go! "
13,21,187,TOGEKISS,[APPEARING] 
13,21,188,ASH,"Good luck, guys! "
13,21,189,"STARAPTOR, TOGEKISS",[CONFIDENT] 
13,21,190,MAMIE,I've got to find Glameow! 
13,21,191,BROCK,They're on the case! It'll be soon! 
13,21,192,DAWN,"Yeah, no need to worry! "
13,21,193,PIKACHU,[REASSURING] 
13,21,194,PIPLUP,[REASSURING] 
13,21,195,MAMIE,Okay! 
13,21,196,JESSIE,Hmm... Glameow's Poké Ball's missing. Strange... 
13,21,197,JAMES,"True, as is Meowth! "
13,21,198,JESSIE,Something's not adding up... 
13,21,199,JAMES,Zots! Your back! 
13,21,200,JAMES,With a Meowth print for a seal! 
13,21,201,JESSIE,"It says... ""Don't look for me. I'm out of here. The long-held dream the three of us shared of conquering all of Sinnoh is completely over for me, and my short and long-term goal now is to live a long and happy life filled to the brim with gobs of domestic bliss along with my beloved babe Glameow. Dig?"" "
13,21,202,JAMES,"Here! ""And so I hereby tender my resignation-"" "
13,21,203,MEOWTH,"""-as a long-standing member of Team Rocket and hope you guys have a nice day."" "
13,21,204,JAMES,"Meowth resigned from Team Rocket lock, stock, and paws! "
13,21,205,JAMES,Falling in love with a Glameow and throwing one's life away! 
13,21,206,JESSIE,"Not only throwing one's life away, but running away as well! "
13,21,207,JAMES,I'll guarantee you Meowth was planning this right from the get-go... 
13,21,208,JESSIE,That punk played us like a violin! I feel so... messed with! 
13,21,209,JAMES,A fine how-dee-doo after the years of thieving bliss Team Rocket rendered! 
13,21,210,JESSIE,I will never ever forgive that ingrate! 
13,21,211,JAMES,Nor I! 
13,21,212,JAMES,Now where's that Charm? Show me a sign! 
13,21,213,JESSIE,"One hint, then... bang, zoom! "
13,21,214,JESSIE,Staraptor? 
13,21,215,JAMES,What? A Togekiss! 
13,21,216,ASH,Found you! 
13,21,217,ASH,"Staraptor, quick! Brave Bird! "

13,21,222,ASH,Give us back that Poké Ball! 
13,21,223,MAMIE,"And I want my Glameow back, right now! "
13,21,224,JESSIE,Sorry. Not here. 
13,21,225,DAWN,"What do you mean, not here? "
13,21,226,JAMES,They both left the premises! 
13,21,227,ASH,Both of them? 
13,21,228,JESSIE,That would equal Meowth and Glameow. 
13,21,229,MAMIE,Why would my Glameow run away with your Meowth? 
13,21,230,DAWN,I'll bet you it was one of Meowth's tricks! 
13,21,231,BROCK,I'll bet you're right! 
13,21,232,MAMIE,My poor little Glameow! 
13,21,233,JESSIE,Here's the deal! Whoever finds them keeps them both! 
13,21,234,JAMES,"Since we'll find them first, that's fair! "
13,21,235,ASH,"Hey, hold on, Team Rocket! "
13,21,236,ASH,"Come on, we'd better hurry! "

13,21,247,JESSIE,Aha! Busted! 
13,21,248,ASH,There they are!

13,21,287,JESSIE,Talk about not knowing your own strength... 
13,21,288,MEOWTH,"Being a strong Pokémon's got nothing to do with strategies or training or techniques or even Twerps. It's love, baby! "
13,21,289,MEOWTH,And nothing floats my boat like a sh*t of my baby's love! It gives me the strength of ten Meowth! Eleven on a good day!

13,21,307,POKEDEX,"Purugly. The Tiger Cat Pokémon, and the evolved form of Glameow. By wrapping its tail around itself, it can appear to be bigger, and when locking eyes with another, can stare forever. "
13,21,308,JAMES,Oops... 
13,21,309,JESSIE,"Okay, time out! "
13,21,310,JESSIE,That was a mistake... 
13,21,311,MEOWTH,Huh? What's Purugly doing where Glameow was? 
13,21,312,PURUGLY,[CRANKY] 
13,21,313,PURUGLY,[DEMANDING] 
13,21,314,MEOWTH,What do you mean you're hungry so hurry up and bring you some grub and make it super fast? Where's all that stuff coming from? 
13,21,315,PURUGLY,[DEMANDING] 
13,21,316,MEOWTH,What do you mean you wouldn't have to do a thing that you wouldn't have to lift a paw forever and ever? And why are you saying I got to make good on my word? 
13,21,317,PURUGLY,[DEMANDING] 
13,21,318,MEOWTH,No fair! I want my gorgeous Glameow back! 
13,21,319,JESSIE,"While you were being flighty, Glameow evolved into Purugly. "
13,21,320,MEOWTH,Purugly evolved from Glameow? 
13,21,321,MEOWTH,No... not that! 
13,21,322,MEOWTH,"Come on, why me? My Glameow was the cutest thing on four pegs! "
13,21,323,PURUGLY,[DISMISSIVE] 
13,21,324,MEOWTH,You couldn't have asked before you evolved... 
13,21,325,JESSIE,"Meowth, wake up and smell the coffee! Seviper! "
13,21,326,SEVIPER,[att*ck] 
13,21,327,MEOWTH,"I don't know where my love went, but it bought a one-way ticket... "
13,21,328,ASH,Give Purugly back right now! 
13,21,329,INFERNAPE,[FLAMETHROWER MOVE] 
13,21,330,MEOWTH,I'll feed you if you wake me up from this nightmare! 
13,21,331,PURUGLY,[DISMISSIVE] 
13,21,332,JESSIE,Losing that loving feeling after evolving doesn't bode well for love in the first place... 
13,21,333,JAMES,One needs to consider Meowth's position as well! 
13,21,334,MAMIE,Purugly! 
13,21,335,DAWN,"That's awesome, Mamie! "
13,21,336,MAMIE,"The funniest part is, I always wanted Glameow to evolve into a Purugly anyway! "
13,21,337,MEOWTH,"Like I always say, it's the best thing for a Pokémon and its Trainer to hang tough! "
13,21,338,JESSIE,The heart mends quickly... 
13,21,339,PURUGLY,[GROWL] 
13,21,340,MEOWTH,"Look, kid! I know this may be hard to do, but it's best for everyone if you somehow forget about us...me... "
13,21,341,MEOWTH,"Besides, following the way of battle is important for a Pokémon! "
13,21,342,BROCK,"Now that Glameow evolved into Purugly, it's much stronger! "
13,21,343,MAMIE,You're right! It can use more moves now! 
13,21,344,MAMIE,"And now, for leading my dear Pokémon on, Meowth needs justice! Purugly, Hyper Beam! "
13,21,345,PURUGLY,[HYPER BEAM MOVE] 
13,21,346,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH, SEVIPER",[IMPACT] 
13,21,347,JESSIE,"Meowth, I think a little fence-mending is in order, don't you? "
13,21,348,JAMES,Rejoining Team Rocket might be as good a place to start as any... 
13,21,349,MEOWTH,Least I won't have to make you a sandwich! 
13,21,350,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",We're blasting off again! 
13,21,351,ASH,"So Mamie, we're heading out for the Sunyshore Gym! "
13,21,352,MAMIE,We're going to the Pastoria Gym once more! Purugly and I will try it again! 
13,21,353,DAWN,No need to worry! You'll win it this time! 
13,21,354,MAMIE,We'll just use Purugly's Hyper Beam and earn us a Gym badge! 
13,21,355,BROCK,We'll be rooting for you. 
13,21,356,ASH,See you! 
13,21,357,MAMIE,"Take care, everyone! "
13,21,358,ASH,"Sunyshore Gym, here we come! Ready to rock, Pikachu? "
13,21,359,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
13,21,360,NARRATOR,"Now that Glameow has evolved into a powerful Purugly after being safely returned to Mamie, our heroes now turn their attention to the Sunyshore Gym and all the excitement that's sure to be waiting there, so stay tuned"
13,20,0,NARRATOR,"The much-anticipated Pokémon Contest Grand Festival is under way! And, after two semifinal battles featuring Zoey versus Nando and Dawn versus Jessilina, only two Coordinators remain! The two winners, Zoey and Dawn, have advanced to the final round and are about to be part of what is sure to be one of the most important battles of their lives! It's about you It's about me It's about hope It's about dreams It's about friends that work together To claim their destiny It's about reaching for the skies Pokemon! Given the courage And willing to try It's about never giving up So hold your head up And we will carry on... Sinnoh League Victors Pokemon! "
13,20,1,MARIAN,Five minutes on the clock! And begin! 
13,20,2,DAWN,Piplup! Togekiss! Spotlight! 
13,20,3,ZOEY,"Glameow and Gallade! Curtain, let's go! "
13,20,4,PIPLUP,[APPEARING] 
13,20,5,GLAMEOW,[APPEARING] 
13,20,6,DAWN,"Now Piplup, Togekiss, because Zoey is our most challenging opponent yet, you can't let your guard down, ever! "
13,20,7,PIPLUP,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,20,8,DAWN,"I remember back at the Jubilife Contest, when Zoey said that we should meet again at the final stage... Those words became my goal, and now look! They've actually become reality. Amazing! I can't thank Zoey enough! "
13,20,9,ZOEY,"Dawn's really made it to the final round. But now, she's my opponent, and the title of Top Coordinator is on the line. I hope we both give it everything we've got and make this a battle to be proud of! "
13,20,10,ZOEY,"Okay, Glameow and Gallade, let's go! "
13,20,11,GLAMEOW,[DETERMINED] 
13,20,12,GALLADE,[DETERMINED] 
13,20,13,ASH,A Gallade? 
13,20,14,POKEDEX,"Gallade. The Blade Pokémon, and the evolved form of Kirlia. Gallade extends its elbows as if they were swords, and when protecting someone, it fights fiercely. "
13,20,15,ASH,That means she evolved her Kirlia! Whoa... 
13,20,16,PIKACHU,[IMPRESSED] 
13,20,17,BROCK,"This is the first time Dawn's battling against a Gallade, and the same goes for Zoey and Dawn's Togekiss as well! "
13,20,18,JOHANNA,"Which makes them even, I would say... "
13,20,19,ASH,[SURPRISED] 
13,20,20,JOHANNA,"Hi there, everyone! "
13,20,21,ASH,"Oh wow, it's Johanna! "
13,20,22,PIKACHU,[GREETING] 
13,20,23,BROCK,Please! I insist that you join us! 
13,20,24,JOHANNA,"Thanks Brock, that's very nice! "
13,20,25,ASH,"So wait, you're saying they're even? "
13,20,26,JOHANNA,Neither one of them knows what kind of combination moves their opponent's new Pokémon has. So I'd say that - makes them even! - 
13,20,27,ASH,That makes sense... 
13,20,28,DAWN,"Now, Piplup, jump! "
13,20,29,PIPLUP,[EXERTION] 
13,20,30,DAWN,"And Togekiss, Aura Sphere! "
13,20,31,TOGEKISS,[AURA SPHERE MOVE] 
13,20,32,DAWN,"Piplup, Bubble Beam, let's go! "
13,20,33,PIPLUP,[BUBBLE BEAM MOVE] 
13,20,34,MARIAN,A combination right off! Dawn has skillfully combined Aura Sphere and Bubble Beam! 
13,20,35,ASH,"Yeah, that's awesome! It worked! "
13,20,36,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
13,20,37,BROCK,The team of Togekiss and Piplup isn't missing a b*at! They're off to a good start! 
13,20,38,ZOEY,"Glameow, use Shadow Claw, and Gallade, Psycho Cut! "
13,20,39,GLAMEOW,[SHADOW CLAW MOVE] 
13,20,40,MARIAN,And Glameow's Shadow Claw splits the Aura Sphere in half! 
13,20,41,PIPLUP,[SHOCKED] 
13,20,42,GALLADE,[PSYCHO CUT MOVE] 
13,20,43,MARIAN,Gallade nails an even more beautiful counter with Psycho Cut! 
13,20,44,DAWN,Beautiful... 
13,20,45,FANTINA,Wow! Such a beautiful yet stern att*ck is no less than a move magnifique by Mademoiselle Zoey! 
13,20,46,JAMES,"Something you'd only witness in a Double Battle, that! "
13,20,47,MEOWTH,That Gallade's a smooth operator! 
13,20,48,JESSILINA [JESSIE],"The glasses Twerpette's nothing to sneeze at, trust me! "
13,20,49,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,20,50,DAWN,"I know how good Zoey is. I'll have to go on the offense and take control of this battle right now! All right, Togekiss, up! "
13,20,51,TOGEKISS,[CALLING] 
13,20,52,GLAMEOW,[SURPRISED] 
13,20,53,TOGEKISS,[CHALLENGING] 
13,20,54,ZOEY,[SURPRISED] 
13,20,55,DAWN,"All right, Piplup, use Hydro Pump! "
13,20,56,PIPLUP,[FOCUSED] 
13,20,57,ZOEY,Glameow! 
13,20,58,GLAMEOW,[EXERTION] 
13,20,59,JOHANNA,That's brilliant! Immediately responding to Zoey's call! 
13,20,60,ZOEY,Use Fake Out! 
13,20,61,GLAMEOW,[GREETING] 
13,20,62,PIPLUP,[SURPRISED] 
13,20,63,GLAMEOW,[FAKE OUT MOVE] 
13,20,64,PIPLUP,[IMPACT] 
13,20,65,DAWN,"Piplup, no! "
13,20,66,PIPLUP,[STRUGGLING] 
13,20,67,DAWN,"Nicely done, Zoey... "
13,20,68,MARIAN,"And Glameow nails Fake Out, leaving Piplup unable to use its move! "
13,20,69,PIPLUP,[DETERMINED] 
13,20,70,ASH,That's Fake Out? 
13,20,71,BROCK,Fake Out is a priority move that always makes its target flinch. And it's because of Fake Out that Piplup wasn't able to use Hydro Pump! 
13,20,72,JESSILINA [JESSIE],"That move is an absolute must! Learn it now, Meowth! "
13,20,73,JAMES,Do! We'll render Pikachu's Thunderbolt null and void! 
13,20,74,MEOWTH,"Not that easy, if you haven't heard... "
13,20,75,ZOEY,"Gallade, use Vacuum Wave on Togekiss! "
13,20,76,GALLADE,[VACUUM WAVE MOVE] 
13,20,77,DAWN,"Togekiss, use Air Slash! "
13,20,78,TOGEKISS,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,20,79,ZOEY,It dodged that? 
13,20,80,TOGEKISS,[AIR SLASH MOVE] 
13,20,81,GALLADE,[EXERTION] 
13,20,82,ZOEY,"That Togekiss is surprisingly agile. Amazing! And since my Pokémon can't fly, tricky as well... "
13,20,83,MARIAN,Gallade and Togekiss's moves have been judged even! Both sides have elegantly dodged their opponent's att*ck! 
13,20,84,ZOEY,"All right, Dawn, now it's my turn! Gallade, use Signal Beam, and Glameow, Iron Tail! "
13,20,85,GALLADE,[SIGNAL BEAM MOVE] 
13,20,86,GLAMEOW,[IRON TAIL MOVE] 
13,20,87,DAWN,What's she planning this time? 
13,20,88,GLAMEOW,[EXERTION] 
13,20,89,MARIAN,"Another new collaboration move! Spun by Glameow's Iron Tail, the colorful Signal Beam grows even larger and is giving off an even more beautiful glow! "
13,20,90,JOHANNA,"By using Iron Tail's power, Zoey's succeeded in bringing out Signal Beam's sparkle even more! She's making the most out of Glameow's tail. "
13,20,91,DAWN,"You're not the only one with a spinning move, Zoey! Piplup, Whirlpool! "
13,20,92,ZOEY,"Blast it, Glameow! "
13,20,93,GLAMEOW,[EXERTION] 
13,20,94,DAWN,"Piplup, do it! "
13,20,95,PIPLUP,[FOCUSED] 
13,20,96,DAWN,"And Togekiss, Aura Sphere! "
13,20,97,TOGEKISS,[AURA SPHERE MOVE] 
13,20,98,MARIAN,"Incredible! Whirlpool and Aura Sphere have combined into a powerful move! This is an offense-and-defense move you'll only see in a Double Battle! And again, their moves are judged even! "
13,20,99,ASH,"Wow, they both lost the same amount of points! "
13,20,100,BROCK,"Yeah, but remember, Zoey got a huge lead right from the start. And because of that lead, Zoey's still ahead. "
13,20,101,ASH,No need to worry! Dawn's just getting started! She's got plenty of time to turn it around. 
13,20,102,ZOEY,"Gallade, use Swords Dance! "
13,20,103,GALLADE,[SWORDS DANCE MOVE] 
13,20,104,DAWN,"Gallade powered up... Two can play at that game! Now, Togekiss, use Safeguard! "
13,20,105,TOGEKISS,[SAFEGUARD MOVE] 
13,20,106,MARIAN,And Safeguard surrounds Togekiss! That soft sparkle is truly mesmerizing! 
13,20,107,MARIAN,Safeguard and Togekiss's elegance are earning points in Dawn's favor! 
13,20,108,ASH,So why did Dawn use Safeguard right now? 
13,20,109,BROCK,Probably worried about status-changing moves. 
13,20,110,JOHANNA,I think they're both trying to feel out each other's next move! 
13,20,111,ZOEY,"Now, Glameow, Shadow Claw! "
13,20,112,GLAMEOW,[SHADOW CLAW MOVE] 
13,20,113,MARIAN,Wow! Watch the sparks when Shadow Claw hits the stage floor! 
13,20,114,DAWN,"A Ghost-type move has no effect on Togekiss because it's also a Normal type, so what's Zoey trying to do? "
13,20,115,BROCK,Maybe Zoey's trying to confuse Dawn by purposefully using an ineffective Ghost-type move. 
13,20,116,DAWN,"All right, Togekiss, Sky att*ck! "
13,20,117,TOGEKISS,[SKY att*ck MOVE] 
13,20,118,ZOEY,"Right where I want you, Dawn! Now, Gallade, use Psycho Cut! "
13,20,119,GALLADE,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,20,120,DAWN,"I knew that was coming! Now, Piplup, use Peck on Gallade! "
13,20,121,PIPLUP,[PECK MOVE] 
13,20,122,JOHANNA,I'm afraid that Dawn's fallen into Zoey's trap by focusing all her attention on Gallade! 
13,20,123,GALLADE,[PSYCHO CUT MOVE] 
13,20,124,PIPLUP,[IMPACT] 
13,20,125,GLAMEOW,[EXERTION] 
13,20,126,TOGEKISS,[SURPRISED] 
13,20,127,GALLADE,[EXERTION] 
13,20,128,PIPLUP,[EXERTION] 
13,20,129,DAWN,Where's Togekiss? 
13,20,130,TOGEKISS,[FRANTIC] 
13,20,131,MARIAN,Glameow's jumped on Togekiss's back and is refusing - to get off! - 
13,20,132,DAWN,No way! 
13,20,133,PIPLUP,[CONCERNED] 
13,20,134,ASH,Zoey did that on purpose? 
13,20,135,JOHANNA,"It's obvious to me Zoey's strategy was to show off Psycho Cut and Shadow Claw in a flashy manner, which ended up grabbing Dawn's attention while taking her attention off of Togekiss! "
13,20,136,BROCK,"A Coordinator has to be able to command two Pokémon at all times during a Double Battle, which means the strategy of distracting your opponent can end up being really effective! "
13,20,137,JOHANNA,"And it's a strategy you'd only find in a Double Battle, too. It's an advanced technique that requires Coordinator and Pokémon to be in perfect sync, or it won't work. "
13,20,138,ASH,Zoey's something... Dawn! Togekiss! You can do it! Hang in there! 
13,20,139,TOGEKISS,[FRANTIC] 
13,20,140,JOHANNA,Togekiss has completely forgotten it's a performance... 
13,20,141,BROCK,"When it comes to elegance, Togekiss's performances are in a league of their own, but with battle experience, Togekiss comes up a bit short! "
13,20,142,ZOEY,"Glameow, use Thunderbolt! "
13,20,143,GLAMEOW,[THUNDERBOLT MOVE] 
13,20,144,TOGEKISS,[SAFEGUARD MOVE] 
13,20,145,GLAMEOW,[SHOCKED] 
13,20,146,DAWN,Togekiss! 
13,20,147,TOGEKISS,[DETERMINED] 
13,20,148,MARIAN,"Safeguard has been activated! It was used earlier, but it's surprisingly protecting Togekiss now! "
13,20,149,FANTINA,"Glameow's Thunderbolt may be magnifique, but Togekiss's Safeguard protecting Togekiss in such a powerful way is magnifique as well! Incroyable! "
13,20,150,DAWN,"Yeah! Piplup, let's give Togekiss a hand! "
13,20,151,PIPLUP,[EAGER] 
13,20,152,ZOEY,"Oh no you don't! Go, Gallade! "
13,20,153,GALLADE,[URGENT] 
13,20,154,PIPLUP,[DETERMINED] 
13,20,155,GALLADE,[DEFIANT] 
13,20,156,DAWN,"Piplup, go on through! "
13,20,157,PIPLUP,[EXERTION] 
13,20,158,ZOEY,"Now, Gallade, use Vacuum Wave! "
13,20,159,GALLADE,[VACUUM WAVE MOVE] 
13,20,160,DAWN,Dodge it! 
13,20,161,PIPLUP,[EXERTION] 
13,20,162,PIPLUP,[EXERTION] 
13,20,163,GALLADE,[PAINED] 
13,20,164,PIPLUP,[URGENT] 
13,20,165,MARIAN,Piplup is flying through the air! 
13,20,166,DAWN,"Piplup, use Hydro Pump! "
13,20,167,PIPLUP,[HYDRO PUMP MOVE] 
13,20,168,GLAMEOW,[IMPACT] 
13,20,169,TOGEKISS,[HAPPY] 
13,20,170,PIPLUP,[PLEASED] 
13,20,171,DAWN,Way to go! 
13,20,172,MARIAN,"Togekiss is free again, thanks to Piplup! "
13,20,173,ZOEY,"Wow... Who would've thought Dawn would show off Piplup's moves in such a natural way? Gallade, use Psycho Cut! "
13,20,174,GALLADE,[PSYCHO CUT MOVE] 
13,20,175,TOGEKISS,[CONFIDENT] 
13,20,176,PIPLUP,[IMPRESSED] 
13,20,177,ASH,"You're on a roll, you two, so keep it up! "
13,20,178,PIKACHU,[CHEERING] 
13,20,179,DAWN,"Zoey, I think the real battle begins now! "
13,20,180,MARIAN,"What a stream of beautiful offensive and defensive moves, worthy of the final stage of the Grand Festival! So who will win the honor of Top Coordinator? Zoey or Dawn? "
13,20,181,TOGEKISS,[EXCITED] 
13,20,182,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
13,20,183,ZOEY,"Gallade, separate Piplup and Togekiss by using Psycho Cut! "
13,20,184,GALLADE,[PSYCHO CUT MOVE] 
13,20,185,DAWN,Dodge it! 
13,20,186,TOGEKISS,[EXERTION] 
13,20,187,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
13,20,188,PIPLUP,[SURPRISED] 
13,20,189,TOGEKISS,[CONCERNED] 
13,20,190,DAWN,Oh no! 
13,20,191,DAWN,"Quick! Piplup, use Whirlpool, and Togekiss, help Piplup out! "
13,20,192,PIPLUP,[WHIRLPOOL MOVE] 
13,20,193,GALLADE,[SURPRISED] 
13,20,194,TOGEKISS,[CONFIDENT] 
13,20,195,GALLADE,[SHOCKED] 
13,20,196,ZOEY,"I see! You're distracting me, too, huh? "
13,20,197,TOGEKISS,[FOCUSED] 
13,20,198,PIPLUP,[FOCUSED] 
13,20,199,GALLADE,[DETERMINED] 
13,20,200,ZOEY,"Glameow, use Iron Tail! "
13,20,201,GLAMEOW,[IRON TAIL MOVE] 
13,20,202,MARIAN,Incredible! Glameow's tail has caught Piplup's Whirlpool! 
13,20,203,ASH,What happened? 
13,20,204,JOHANNA,Obviously Zoey's trained really hard and gotten really good at using Glameow's tail! 
13,20,205,MARIAN,Amazing how Zoey can show off such an imaginative move using Iron Tail! Elegant! 
13,20,206,ZOEY,"Now, Gallade, use Vacuum Wave! "
13,20,207,GALLADE,[VACUUM WAVE MOVE] 
13,20,208,MARIAN,Gallade's Vacuum Wave bursts the Whirlpool and beautifully showers Gallade and Glameow! 
13,20,209,DAWN,"We are not going to lose! Piplup, use Peck! Togekiss, use Sky att*ck! "
13,20,210,TOGEKISS,[SKY att*ck MOVE] 
13,20,211,PIPLUP,[PECK MOVE] 
13,20,212,MARIAN,Togekiss's Sky att*ck and Piplup's Peck have combined to create a move with unbelievably expl*sive power! 
13,20,213,FANTINA,Oh! That move's as powerful as can be! 
13,20,214,MARIAN,"Dawn and Zoey's points are neck and neck! And with seconds left on the clock, who knows who will win this battle? "
13,20,215,ASH,Yes! She caught up to Zoey! 
13,20,216,PIKACHU,[THRILLED] 
13,20,217,BROCK,"If Dawn can nail one final move, she'll be the winner! "
13,20,218,ZOEY,"Gallade, use Psycho Cut, and Glameow, Thunderbolt! "
13,20,219,GLAMEOW,[THUNDERBOLT MOVE] 
13,20,220,DAWN,"Piplup and Togekiss, you're the best! Let's go! "
13,20,221,PIPLUP,[att*ck] 
13,20,222,GALLADE,[PSYCHO CUT MOVE] 
13,20,223,MARIAN,Time's up! 
13,20,224,MARIAN,And the winning Coordinator on the final stage is... 
13,20,225,MARIAN,It's Zoey! 
13,20,226,MARIAN,Which of course means that Zoey is the winner of the Pokémon Contest Grand Festival and takes home the highly esteemed title of Top Coordinator! 
13,20,227,GALLADE,[TRIUMPHANT] 
13,20,228,ZOEY,"Thanks, Glameow, Gallade... It's been a long road, huh? "

13,20,230,GALLADE,[PLEASED] 
13,20,231,DAWN,"Congratulations, Zoey! You really are amazing... "

13,20,233,TOGEKISS,[EMOTIONAL] 
13,20,234,DAWN,I did everything I could. And this is the result. But...I'm okay! 
13,20,235,ASH,And after all that catching up she did in the second half... 
13,20,236,PIKACHU,[SAD] 
13,20,237,BROCK,It simply means Zoey's performance was judged a little higher at the end... 
13,20,238,JOHANNA,But that doesn't mean this is the end! It's just the beginning! 
13,20,239,JESSILINA [JESSIE] ,"I told the Twerpette she'd better not lose! And just like a Twerpette, she had the gall to defy my threats anyway! Enough! Back to the salt mines! "
13,20,240,JAMES,"Well, Team Rocket awaits! "
13,20,241,MEOWTH,"Besides, we've got work to do! "
13,20,242,JESSIE,"You bet! So, let's pinch us a Pikachu! "
13,20,243,JAMES,Woohoo! 
13,20,244,MARIAN,"And now, Fantina is presenting Zoey with the spectacular victory trophy! Congratulations, Zoey! We look forward to all of your future endeavors as Top Coordinator! "

13,20,249,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
13,20,250,DAWN,"Wow, when did you get here? Did you see the final stage? "
13,20,251,JOHANNA,"I saw your entire performance from the very beginning, dear! "
13,20,252,DAWN,"Sorry, Mom. I lost. "
13,20,253,JOHANNA,"Yes, but I'm still so very proud of you, Dawn! Your battling was just great! "
13,20,254,DAWN,"Wow, really? Thanks a lot, Mom! "
13,20,255,ASH,"I'll tell you, you and your Pokémon were so cool today! Piplup and Togekiss's combinations were like the most amazing stuff I've ever seen! "
13,20,256,PIKACHU,[IMPRESSED] 
13,20,257,PIPLUP,[PROUD] 
13,20,258,BROCK,"It really was a fantastic battle, Dawn. "
13,20,259,ASH,You and Zoey got us all fired up bigtime! I was going crazy! 
13,20,260,DAWN,"Thanks a lot, really! Oh, that's right... Here! "
13,20,261,JOHANNA,"Oh, is that... "
13,20,262,DAWN,It's the ribbon you gave to me back in Twinleaf Town when I started my journey. 
13,20,263,DAWN,"Thanks for lending it to me! I was going to give it back to you after the Grand Festival was through! I can't tell you how much this ribbon has meant to me, Mom... And I'm going to be just fine! After all, I have these five ribbons. And now... "
13,20,264,DAWN,I've got a bunch of wonderful friends! And what's also going to support me from here on out is everything I've gained through my hard work! Wait.am I being a little too sappy? 
13,20,265,JOHANNA,I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that! 
13,20,266,JOHANNA,"Well then, there's lots I'd like to discuss about today's performance with you. The good things...and the bad...and the close calls. I figure it couldn't hurt to get a little observation and advice from a former Top Coordinator, after all! "
13,20,267,DAWN,That'd be great! - 
13,20,268,NURSE JOY,Ash? - 
13,20,269,ASH,Nurse Joy! 
13,20,270,NURSE JOY,"I just received a call from Volkner, Sunyshore City's Gym Leader. "
13,20,271,ASH,From Volkner? 
13,20,272,NURSE JOY,"He said he's ready to have your Gym battle, and you're - welcome to come back anytime! - "
13,20,273,ASH,That's awesome! 
13,20,274,BROCK,You've been really looking forward to that! 
13,20,275,DAWN,Your eighth badge! And the eighth one's the charm! 
13,20,276,ASH,"It sure is! Dawn, I'll make our Gym battle as amazing as your battle with Zoey! Yeah, you just wait and see! "

13,20,279,DAWN,No prob! It was a blast! 
13,20,280,DAWN,So...what's up next? 
13,20,281,ZOEY,"Heading back to Snowpoint City! When I called Candice to tell her the news, she was like, ""We're going to celebrate, so get back here on the double!"" "
13,20,282,DAWN,That's Candice for you! 
13,20,283,NANDO,Zoey. Dawn. 
13,20,284,DAWN,"Hi there, Nando! "
13,20,285,NANDO,"Your battle was truly brilliant. You know, life with Pokémon is something.it's profound. And now, after this, I'm going to train even harder preparing for the Sinnoh League! "
13,20,286,ZOEY,Nando...it was an honor to battle you. I feel like I got stronger! 
13,20,287,NANDO,Same for me! I'll use what I've learned in my next Gym battle. I only need one more badge to enter the Sinnoh League. 
13,20,288,NANDO,Take good care...until we meet again. 
13,20,289,ZOEY,Candice told me she'd love it if you came along with me to celebrate! Want to come? 
13,20,290,DAWN,"Thanks, but I still have a lot to do! - "
13,20,291,ZOEY,"Cheering for Ash, right? - "
13,20,292,DAWN,Yup! 
13,20,293,ZOEY,"Then Dawn, you go cheer your heart out! "
13,20,294,DAWN,Course I will! 
13,20,295,ZOEY,"Okay then, later! "

13,20,300,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
13,20,301,DAWN,"I am so lucky to have you all! So let's work hard, and someday I'll be Top Coordinator! "
13,20,302,PIPLUP,[ENTHUSIASTIC] 
13,20,303,NARRATOR,"True, this Pokémon Contest Grand Festival has come to an end, but Dawn's exciting challenges.and the journey.continue"
13,19,0,NARRATOR,"As the Battle Stage of the Pokémon Contest Grand Festival got underway, Dawn's opponent in the first round was none other than Ursula! But battling with her Pachirisu and Mamoswine, Dawn was able to emerge victorious, thanks in part to her brand new Ice Chandelier Combination! "
13,19,1,NARRATOR,"Also victorious on the Battle Stage were rivals Zoey.the Pokémon Minstrel Nando...and Jessilina, all advancing smoothly during the proceedings. And so, as the action builds, it begs the question: which one of these four semi - finalists will win the prestigious title of Top Coordinator? It's about you It's about me It's about hope It's about dreams It's about friends that work together To claim their destiny It's about reaching for the skies Pokemon! Given the courage And willing to try It's about never giving up So hold your head up And we will carry on... Sinnoh League Victors Pokemon! "
13,19,2,MARIAN,And that does it! The winner of the fourth battle of the third round is none other than... Jessilina! 
13,19,3,JESSIE,"Thank you! Kiss, kiss! Love, love! Me, me! Yes![EXCITED] "
13,19,4,JAMES,Mime Jr. and Carnivine are a league unto their own... I'm swelling with pride! 
13,19,5,WOBBUFFET,[PROUD] 
13,19,6,MEOWTH,The crowd's swollen too! 
13,19,7,MEOWTH,And we're swollen with moolah now that we sold all those Jessilina cards. She's a hot commodity! 
13,19,8,WOBBUFFET,[AGREEMENT] 
13,19,9,FANTINA,Carnivine and Mime Jr. were both magnifique! Très adorable! 
13,19,10,JESSIE,"And since they were so adorable, the final round will be such a waste of time! So why don't you just save us all that time and declare me Top Coordinator? "
13,19,11,FANTINA,Impossible! You'll just have to win this one all by yourself! 
13,19,12,JESSIE,You big meanie... 
13,19,13,DAWN,That Jessilina... 
13,19,14,MARIAN,"And now this marks the completion of all our quarterfinal battles! Also, that means all of the Coordinators that will compete in tomorrow's semi-finals have been decided! "
13,19,15,MARIAN,"First, the man who defeated his opponents in the second and third rounds using music as a theme - the Pokémon minstrel, Nando! "
13,19,16,MARIAN,"Next, showing off her Pokémon to the max while executing her impressive battles flawlessly, it's Zoey! "
13,19,17,MARIAN,"Then, it's Dawn, working in perfect synch with her cute Pokémon. Will she be able live up to the reputation of her mother and Top Coordinator, Johanna? "
13,19,18,MARIAN,"And finally, the beautiful and athletic Coordinator who is truly unique and far beyond imitation, Jessilina! "
13,19,19,MARIAN,"These four will be competing against each other to see who will advance to the final round, and it's going to be great! "
13,19,20,MARIAN,"And so, join us again tomorrow for all the action! "
13,19,21,JOHANNA,Call me crazy but I seem more excited than they do! 
13,19,22,GLAMEOW,[EXCITED] 
13,19,23,ASH,"What're you doing out here, Dawn? Dreaming again? "
13,19,24,PIPLUP,[CURIOUS] 
13,19,25,DAWN,The truth is I can hardly believe that tomorrow's the semi-finals! And that there are only four of us out of over a hundred Coordinators! You know? 
13,19,26,DAWN,It really feels like a dream... 
13,19,27,BROCK,But it's reality! 
13,19,28,BROCK,So you're going to have to make sure that you're one of the two tomorrow that makes it out of those four! 
13,19,29,ASH,"And after that, you win the whole thing! "
13,19,30,PIKACHU,[AGREEMENT] 
13,19,31,DAWN,"Yeah, no need to worry! I know I can pull this off! What do you say, Piplup? "
13,19,32,PIPLUP,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,19,33,DAWN,[SURPRISED] 
13,19,34,PIKACHU,[SURPRISED] 
13,19,35,SWABLU,[DELIGHTED] 
13,19,36,DAWN,"Wow, amazing! "
13,19,37,BROCK,They've all been attracted here by Nando's beautiful music! 
13,19,38,NANDO,"Good evening, my friends! "
13,19,39,ASH,Good evening! 
13,19,40,PIKACHU,[GREETING] 
13,19,41,PIPLUP,[GREETING] 
13,19,42,DAWN,Such beautiful and relaxing music! 
13,19,43,NANDO,Having made it this far in the competition has been a complete surprise to me! Luckily I have my music to soothe the day's cares... 
13,19,44,ZOEY,What a relief! 
13,19,45,ZOEY,And here I thought I was the only one who couldn't get to sleep! 
13,19,46,DAWN,"Hi, Zoey! "
13,19,47,ZOEY,"Hey, Nando - here's to a great show tomorrow! "
13,19,48,NANDO,Thanks! 
13,19,49,ZOEY,"And the same goes for you, Dawn! "
13,19,50,BROCK,"You know, I can't help but wonder what Dawn's opponent is doing right about now... "
13,19,51,JESSIE,This is all genuine Jessilina memorabilia? 
13,19,52,JAMES,"Of course! Who wouldn't want a piece of Jessilina superstar, tip - Top Coordinator? "
13,19,53,MEOWTH,"Those cards with your mug on them blew the lid right off of this joint, and this stuff's going to put us in serious moolah orbit! "
13,19,54,JESSIE,Top Coordinator...I like it! 
13,19,55,JESSIE,Stardom! 
13,19,56,JESSIE,In demand! 
13,19,57,JESSIE,The first fashionista in the land! 
13,19,58,JESSIE,A legend in my own mind - and perfectly timed! 
13,19,59,JESSIE,Final Stage - make me your latest rage! 
13,19,60,JAMES,I can see a brilliant future forming in our midst! 
13,19,61,MEOWTH,Two more battles and the big Coordinator buck stops here! 
13,19,62,WOBBUFFET,[EXCITED] 
13,19,63,MARIAN,The morning finds a stadium filled with a flurry of fans! 
13,19,64,MARIAN,"Welcome to the event where dreams can either be made or dashed, the exciting Grand Festival semi-finals! "
13,19,65,FANTINA,"Bon matin! Now, to all the many Coordinators, amazing Pokémon and loyal fans alike... "
13,19,66,FANTINA,Let's cheer! Excitement is here! 
13,19,67,FANTINA,Merci! Merci! 
13,19,68,MARIAN,"Here in the semi-finals, Coordinators will compete in two-on-two Double Battles! And the object is to be able to strip away points from their opponents with beautiful moves within five minutes! "
13,19,69,MARIAN,So now it's time for the first battle of the day! 
13,19,70,MARIAN,"On my left, it's Zoey! "
13,19,71,MARIAN,"And on my right, it's Nando! "
13,19,72,MARIAN,We will soon learn which one of them will be advancing on to the Final Stage! 
13,19,73,MARIAN,Five minutes on the clock! And begin! 
13,19,74,ZOEY,"Mismagius! Leafeon! Once again it's curtain, go! "
13,19,75,LEAFEON,[APPEARING] 
13,19,76,ASH,"Wow, so Zoey's Misdreavus evolved... "
13,19,77,BROCK,I'll bet you Nando's going to go with either a Bug - type or a Grass - type... 
13,19,78,DAWN,"Yeah, and I'll bet you they'll be Pokémon that can use the move ""Sing"", you know? "
13,19,79,PIPLUP,[AGREEMENT] 
13,19,80,NANDO,"Kricketune and Lopunny, please! I need your help! "
13,19,81,KRICKETUNE,[APPEARING] 
13,19,82,DAWN,Lopunny? 
13,19,83,BROCK,"Lopunny's not a Bug - type or a Grass - type, and it can't use ""Sing"" either! "
13,19,84,ZOEY,"Leafeon, use Energy Ball! And Mismagius, Thunder Wave! "
13,19,85,LEAFEON,[ENERGY BALL MOVE] 
13,19,86,MISMAGIUS,[THUNDER WAVE MOVE] 
13,19,87,MARIAN,And there's a quick Fusion Move! 
13,19,88,MARIAN,The Energy Ball has fused with the Thunder Wave! 
13,19,89,ASH,That's awesome! 
13,19,90,PIKACHU,[AMAZED] 
13,19,91,BROCK,Even the movements before they launched that move looked impressive! 
13,19,92,DAWN,Leafeon and Mismagius are gorgeous... 
13,19,93,PIPLUP,[AGREEMENT] 
13,19,94,FANTINA,"Très jolie! And if that move hits its mark, it means beaucoup de points! "
13,19,95,NANDO,"All right Lopunny, use Jump Kick and Kricketune use Bug Buzz! "
13,19,96,LOPUNNY,[JUMP KICK MOVE] 
13,19,97,MARIAN,And the Fusion Move is kicked in the air! 
13,19,98,ASH,Oh man! The way he used Zoey's Energy Ball against her! 
13,19,99,BROCK,Really! Amazing power and control all around! 
13,19,100,KRICKETUNE,[BUG BUZZ MOVE] 
13,19,101,LEAFEON,[STRUGGLING] 
13,19,102,MARIAN,Lopunny is using the streamers created by the Bug Buzz like beautiful scarves to wrap around itself - and the fans are in complete awe! 
13,19,103,JESSIE,Dancing? That's novel... 
13,19,104,MARIAN,And Nando scores some serious points with Lopunny's stunning dance! 
13,19,105,ZOEY,Incredible...What a fantastic way of showing off Lopunny... 
13,19,106,MARIAN,Nando is treating the fans to a performance that's a real feast for all the senses! 
13,19,107,BROCK,Lopunny are well - known for having amazing spring - like jumping abilities! 
13,19,108,BROCK,Nando's idea to match that ability with Kricketune's music to make Lopuuny look like a ballerina makes for a magical performance! 
13,19,109,ASH,A gifted dancer and a gifted musician...check it out! 
13,19,110,DAWN,Another Nando masterpiece... 
13,19,111,MARIAN,Look out - The Thunder Energy Ball is roaring straight down! 
13,19,112,KRICKETUNE,[EXERTION] 
13,19,113,MARIAN,The now - exploded Energy Ball is making Lopunny sparkle with beautiful colors! 
13,19,114,FANTINA,Magnifique! 
13,19,115,ASH,Nando even made use of Zoey's fusion move... 
13,19,116,DAWN,I've never seen Zoey under pressure like this... 
13,19,117,PIPLUP,[WORRIED] 
13,19,118,PIKACHU,[WORRIED] 
13,19,119,ZOEY,"Nando's sure tough. He's using his Gym battle experience while he shows off all those beautiful moves! But I've got a few beautiful moves of my own to show off! Mismagius, Leafeon! Double Team go! "
13,19,120,MISMAGIUS,[DOUBLE TEAM MOVE] 
13,19,121,MARIAN,It's a double Double Team! And they've arranged themselves one after another with precision! 
13,19,122,NANDO,Oh my! Such contrast is... stunning... 
13,19,123,LOPUNNY,[WORRIED] 
13,19,124,BROCK,"Zoey's using her Pokémon in perfect synch, while really highlighting the fact that it's a Double Battle! "
13,19,125,ASH,"But so far, Nando's calling the sh*ts... "
13,19,126,DAWN,Which's how it will end if this keeps up! 
13,19,127,NANDO,"All right, Lopunny, Blizzard! "
13,19,128,LOPUNNY,[BLIZZARD MOVE] 
13,19,129,ZOEY,"Okay, here it comes, right? "
13,19,130,MARIAN,Lopunny is eliminating the doubles with Blizzard! 
13,19,131,MARIAN,But Zoey's using the light from the disappearing doubles to cause her actual Pokémon to glow! 
13,19,132,CONTESTA,Spectacular! 
13,19,133,FANTINA,Such a thrill is très belle! 
13,19,134,DAWN,Gorgeous! 
13,19,135,ASH,"I'll tell you, both Nando and Zoey are incredible! "
13,19,136,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
13,19,137,DAWN,Double Team was just a trick to lure Nando into doing what Zoey wanted! 
13,19,138,BROCK,"Zoey knew that disappearing doubles give off light, and she then wisely used it to her own advantage. Wow! "
13,19,139,NANDO,Kricketune! Use Sing! 
13,19,140,KRICKETUNE,[SING MOVE] 
13,19,141,MARIAN,"There it is! Nando's greatest move, ""Sing""! "
13,19,142,ZOEY,"I knew Nando was going to use ""Sing"". Mismagius! Use Lucky Chant! "
13,19,143,MISMAGIUS,[LUCKY CHANT MOVE] 
13,19,144,DAWN,What's Lucky Chant? 
13,19,145,BROCK,"Lucky Chant is a move that prevents your opponent from landing any critical hits for a limited amount of time. But I wonder how that's going to help against ""Sing""? "
13,19,146,MISMAGIUS,[LUCKY CHANT MOVE] 
13,19,147,MISMAGIUS,[LUCKY CHANT MOVE] - 
13,19,148,NANDO,What's that? -
13,19,149,ZOEY,"I'll tell you! Back in the quarterfinals when I learned we'd be battling, I knew who I was going to use - my Mismagius! "
13,19,150,ZOEY,"Because I also knew using Mismagius' Lucky Chant would counter your move ""Sing""! "
13,19,151,LOPUNNY,[SHOCKED] 
13,19,152,MARIAN,This battle is like no other! It's singing battling chanting - so unique! 
13,19,153,DAWN,I think Zoey's starting to turn it around! 
13,19,154,BROCK,So she trained to use Lucky Chant specifically against Nando's best att*ck! 
13,19,155,ASH,What great strategy! 
13,19,156,PIKACHU,[AGREEMENT] 
13,19,157,FANTINA,How exciting! Lucky Chant defeats Sing! Incroyable! 
13,19,158,NANDO,Clever. Zoey has once again used my strategy against me. 
13,19,159,ZOEY,Time to liven things up! Leafeon! Leaf Blade! 
13,19,160,LEAFEON,[LEAF BLADE MOVE] 
13,19,161,NANDO,"Quick, Lopunny! Use Focus Blast! "
13,19,162,LOPUNNY,[FOCUS BLAST MOVE] 
13,19,163,LEAFEON,[EXERTION] 
13,19,164,LOPUNNY,[PAINED][EXERTION] 
13,19,165,MARIAN,And it's a huge hit! Leafeon uses its body to make a double Leaf Blade! 
13,19,166,NANDO,"Kricketune, use X-Scissor against Leafeon! "
13,19,167,ZOEY,"Mismagius, use Psywave against Kricketune, go! "
13,19,168,KRICKETUNE,[X-SCISSOR MOVE] 
13,19,169,MISMAGIUS,[PSYWAVE MOVE] 
13,19,170,NANDO,"Lopunny, help out! "
13,19,171,LOPUNNY,[EXERTION] 
13,19,172,LOPUNNY,[EXERTION] 
13,19,173,LOPUNNY,[EXERTION] 
13,19,174,KRICKETUNE,[PAINED] 
13,19,175,ZOEY,Use Leaf Blade again! You've got to take on that X-Scissor! 
13,19,176,LEAFEON,[LEAF BLADE MOVE] [X-SCISSOR MOVE] 
13,19,177,MARIAN,"Neither side is giving an inch! And the crowd is mesmerized, as they watch this action - packed duel! "
13,19,178,LEAFEON,[EXERTION] 
13,19,179,JESSIE,[SHOCKED] 
13,19,180,DAWN,Man do I wish this battle could go on forever! 
13,19,181,BROCK,[SURPRISED] 
13,19,182,ASH,Forever? 
13,19,183,MISMAGIUS,[ATTACKING] 
13,19,184,DAWN,"The att*cks, the defense... "
13,19,185,DAWN,...and the elegance of it all! I could never do what they're doing! 
13,19,186,DAWN,It's the way they control their own Pokémon while using their opponent's Pokémon's moves to their advantage! 
13,19,187,LEAFEON,[ATTACKING] 
13,19,188,DAWN,They're both excellent! Either one of them could make it to the finals! 
13,19,189,MARIAN,We're at the thirty-second mark! 
13,19,190,DAWN,"It's beautiful - and to see moves like this in a Contest battle is amazing, really! "

13,17,119,ASH,I almost couldn't tell which one was Pikachu! 
13,17,120,DAWN,Almost? Please... 
13,17,121,BROCK,My name's Brock! 
13,17,122,DAWN,I'm Dawn!  
13,17,123,PIPLUP,[FRIENDLY] 
13,17,124,ASH,"And I'm Ash! This's my partner, Pikachu! "
13,17,125,PIKACHU,[FRIENDLY] 
13,17,126,NARISSA,My name's Narissa! You guys just call me Rissa for short... 
13,17,127,DAWN,That's a really cute nickname! 
13,17,128,NARISSA,Hold on! You messing with me? 
13,17,129,DAWN,No way! Of course not! 
13,17,130,NARISSA,"Okay. Back where I come from they call me The Rumbler. Want to fight, I'm ready. "
13,17,131,ASH,Rumbler? What's that mean? 
13,17,132,NARISSA,You just keep your shirt on! Haven't you ever heard of a rumble? - 
13,17,133,ASH,A what now?  - 
13,17,134,NARISSA,Rumble! 
13,17,135,ASH,Okay! I'm on your side! 
13,17,136,BROCK,"So Rissa, are you traveling by yourself? "
13,17,137,NARISSA,"Yeah! I'm a wandering Pokémon Trainer, making the Gym rounds with my Ditto! "
13,17,138,ASH,Cool! You're like me! 
13,17,139,NARISSA,No way! I'm going to be the number one Pokémon Trainer and nothing less! I can't have a noob like you lumping us together. Get it? 
13,17,140,ASH,"I'm not a noob! My dream is to become the world's greatest Pokémon Master, just like you! "
13,17,141,DAWN,"Rissa, have you been on your journey a long time? "
13,17,142,NARISSA,It's already been a whole month! 
13,17,143,ASH,Whoa! A month? That's it? And you're calling me a noob? - 
13,17,144,NARISSA,Yeah! - 
13,17,145,BROCK,Got any badges? 
13,17,146,NARISSA,Zero! Nada! 
13,17,147,DAWN,Zero? 
13,17,148,NARISSA,"Gym Leaders are too scared to battle with me, so they run off before I can win a Gym Badge. That's huge! What do you say, Ditto One and Two? "
13,17,149,"DITTO  , DITTO ",[PROUD] 
13,17,150,DAWN,That sounds kind of weird... 
13,17,151,NARISSA,Are you messing with me again? 
13,17,152,JAMES,Double Ditto... 
13,17,153,JESSIE,I so relate! I can transform just like a Ditto! 
13,17,154,MEOWTH,In more ways than one! Of course! Those Ditto would make the perfect transformational gift for the Boss! 
13,17,155,JAMES,I smell a fantasy scene... 
13,17,156,GIRATINA [MEOWTH],[CHALLENGING] 
13,17,157,REGIGIAS [MEOWTH],[AGGRESSIVE] 
13,17,158,MEOWTH,"It's the Boss business as usual, like finding Giratina and Regigigas locked in a mountainside maul! But, although he tries to bag those big bad beasts, those two have got other plans! "
13,17,159,MEOWTH,"Then, suddenly, without warning- it's the Ditto duo to the rescue! "
13,17,160,"DITTO , DITTO  [MEOWTH]",[EAGER] 
13,17,161,GIOVANNI [MEOWTH],"Without Ditto doing the perfect take on Giratina and Regigigas, I'd be lost! Meowth and friends need to be rewarded handsomely for helping me save face and being all the Boss I can be! "
13,17,162,MEOWTH,Now do you see? 
13,17,163,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",We're on our way! To a transformational payday! 
13,17,164,WOBBUFFET,[EXCITED] 
13,17,165,JAMES,Oh. But it's only a quick fix... 
13,17,166,JESSIE,Quick is good! 
13,17,167,MEOWTH,"Besides, when the Boss smiles, we do! "
13,17,168,ASH,So Rissa! How about you and I Battle? 
13,17,169,NARISSA,Battle? I'll knock your block off! 
13,17,170,ASH,"No, I mean a Pokémon Battle! "
13,17,171,DAWN,"It's not everyday someone gets to battle against a Ditto, you know? "
13,17,172,NARISSA,"I think you should know that I can't be b*at! If you can handle that, let's go! "
13,17,173,ASH,That's what I call confidence! 
13,17,174,BROCK,"So, I'll referee, if you don't mind. What kind of Pokémon do you have, Rissa? "
13,17,175,NARISSA,"You see, Ditto One and Two are my whole life! They're my pals and I'm theirs, twenty-four seven! "
13,17,176,DAWN,Wow! So you're saying all you have are your two Ditto! 
13,17,177,NARISSA,Who asked you? 
13,17,178,BROCK,Then I say the match will be two one-on-one Battles! 
13,17,179,ASH,Okay! 
13,17,180,BROCK,Begin! 
13,17,181,NARISSA,"Ditto One! Don't worry! You can relax! It's you, Two! "
13,17,182,DITTO ,[EAGER]

13,17,189,ASH,Infernape! Use Flame Wheel! 
13,17,190,INFERNAPE,[FLAME WHEEL MOVE] 
13,17,191,NARISSA,"Wow, that's hot! Counter that with Flame Wheel, go! "
13,17,192,INFERNAPE [DITTO ],[FLAME WHEEL MOVE] 
13,17,193,DAWN,"Cool! That means whatever Pokémon Ditto transforms into, it can use its moves! "
13,17,194,NARISSA,You see? You're messing with a pro! 
13,17,195,ASH,"Mach Punch, let's go! "

13,17,210,ASH,"Okay, Pikachu. You ready? "
13,17,211,PIKACHU,[EAGER] 
13,17,212,NARISSA,Now...what to do? 
13,17,213,PIPLUP,[CONFUSED] 
13,17,214,NARISSA,Right! Transform into Piplup! 
13,17,215,DITTO ,[EXCITED] 
13,17,216,PIPLUP [DITTO ],[CHALLENGING] 
13,17,217,DAWN,Why choose Piplup? Water-type Pokémon are weak against Electric types! 
13,17,218,NARISSA,I know what I'm doing! 
13,17,219,ASH,"Pikachu, Thunderbolt, let's go! "
13,17,220,PIKACHU,[THUNDERBOLT MOVE]

13,17,223,PIPLUP [DITTO ],[TRANSFORM MOVE] 
13,17,224,NARISSA,"Now, Pikachu's moves... This one rocks! Iron Tail, go! "
13,17,225,PIKACHU [DITTO ],[IRON TAIL MOVE] 
13,17,226,DAWN,But Iron Tail's a Steel-type move! It's not very effective against an Electric type!

13,17,229,PIKACHU,[QUICK att*ck MOVE]

13,17,237,ASH,"All right, Pikachu! "
13,17,238,PIKACHU,[PLEASED] 
13,17,239,NARISSA,"Ditto, return. The nerve... I don't let anybody embarrass me like that and get away with it so I'm going to get you back, you wait! "
13,17,240,BROCK,That's not a great way to end a Battle... 
13,17,241,DAWN,"Yeah, you're just going to start a fight. "
13,17,242,NARISSA,"That's fine with me! If someone messes with my head, I always get them back! "
13,17,243,ASH,"Okay, so how're you going to get me back? "
13,17,244,NARISSA,Man... the other day both my Ditto transformed into Zapdos and won and that makes Ditto the strongest Pokémon ever ! 
13,17,245,ASH,"Wow, they both did ...and won? "
13,17,246,NARISSA,Yeah! They sure did! 
13,17,247,BROCK,"So you were actually having a Battle at the time, right? "
13,17,248,NARISSA,It didn't even get that far! One look at two Zapdos and they were out of there! 
13,17,249,DAWN,But that means you didn't actually b*at them then... 
13,17,250,NARISSA,"Who cares? A win is a win! That's just how strong my Ditto are, okay? "
13,17,251,BROCK,Not okay! 
13,17,252,BROCK,"Look Rissa, you need to study about your Pokémon a lot more or you'll never be able to bring out your Ditto's true strength! "
13,17,253,NARISSA,But... me study? 
13,17,254,BROCK,"Look. Ditto can transform into any Pokémon, but as their Trainer, if you don't know the moves of the Pokémon they transform into then you won't be able to give your Ditto effective commands! "
13,17,255,NARISSA,What do you know? 
13,17,256,BROCK,Rissa! 
13,17,257,BROCK,"Unless you come to grips with what I'm saying, you'll never grow as a Trainer! "
13,17,258,ASH,Brock? 
13,17,259,NARISSA,You see... You see... 
13,17,260,"ASH, DAWN, PIKACHU",[SURPRISED] 
13,17,261,BROCK,Wait! What's wrong? 
13,17,262,ASH,I thought you said you used to be The Rumbler back at home! 
13,17,263,NARISSA,So I lied... 
13,17,264,"ASH, BROCK, DAWN",You lied? 
13,17,265,NARISSA,"Back home, I was just about as scared as I could be. I felt too scared to be just who I was so I dressed up like Flint! The truth is, I always admired the Elite Four and I wanted to look as tough as I could! "
13,17,266,"ASH, DAWN",Of course! 
13,17,267,DAWN,"Now that you mention it, your hairstyle and outfit look exactly like Flint's! "
13,17,268,NARISSA,So now... what do I do? 
13,17,269,BROCK,You just have to take it easy and learn everything you can about different Pokémon... 
13,17,270,BROCK,"See, Ditto can copy the moves of other Pokémon, but there's no way they can copy their power! If they're going into battle, you'll need to get them into shape! "
13,17,271,NARISSA,Right! 
13,17,272,ASH,"You know, you're actually kind of nice! "
13,17,273,NARISSA,"That's the thing... I am nice! But the truth is, I'm nothing but a big crybaby... "
13,17,274,BROCK,Don't worry! 
13,17,275,BROCK,"All you have to do is study and work hard, and you and your Ditto can grow together! "
13,17,276,NARISSA,"Wow! Please Brock, won't you work with my Ditto and me? "
13,17,277,BROCK,Sure! I'd be happy to! 
13,17,278,BROCK,"First, let's review your Battle from earlier... "
13,17,279,NARISSA,Right! 
13,17,280,BROCK,"Your first opponent was Infernape: a Fire type. Ditto also transformed into an Infernape, but in this case, Fire-type moves aren't really that effective! "
13,17,281,NARISSA,Right! 
13,17,282,BROCK,"So, if Ditto had transformed into Piplup instead, Ditto would have been able to use its Water-type moves, which would have been super-effective! "
13,17,283,NARISSA,I get it! 
13,17,284,BROCK,"Your next opponent was Pikachu. If you look up its moves in the Pokédex, you'll see that Ash's Pikachu knows more than just Electric-type moves, such as Iron Tail, which is a Steel-type move... and Quick att*ck, which is a Normal-type move! "
13,17,285,NARISSA,Question! Why does a Pokémon know moves from types other than theirs? 
13,17,286,BROCK,A great question! The answer is type advantage plays a huge role in a Pokémon Battle. That's why Trainers have their Pokémon learn moves from types other than their own! 
13,17,287,NARISSA,This is great stuff! 
13,17,288,"PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[PLEASED] 
13,17,289,BROCK,"Knowing the kind of moves a Pokémon uses and what kind of effect it has depending on type, you'll end up gaining a decisive advantage when having a Battle! "
13,17,290,NARISSA,Right! 
13,17,291,BROCK,Now let's level you up! And the only way to do that is to get experience from battling! My Happiny here will be your opponent! 
13,17,292,NARISSA,"Right! Ditto One and Ditto Two, Transform now! "
13,17,293,"DITTO , DITTO ",[TRANSFORM MOVE] 
13,17,294,BROCK,"Rissa, make your move and Happiny will take them both! "
13,17,295,NARISSA,"Right! Now Ditto One and Two, use Pound! HAPPINY [DITTO ], "

13,17,304,DAWN,It's like an expl*si*n of Pokémon! 
13,17,305,BROCK,My Sudowoodo will be your opponent next... 
13,17,306,NARISSA,"Right! Okay Ditto One and Two, Transform now! "
13,17,307,"DITTO  , DITTO ",[TRANSFORM MOVE] 
13,17,308,BROCK,"You need to either dodge your opponent's move, or block it instead and use your own move! Those are the basics of the Battle! "
13,17,309,NARISSA,Right! 
13,17,310,BROCK,So try attacking together one more time! 
13,17,311,NARISSA,"Right! Ditto One and Two, use Hammer Arm! SUDOWOODO [DITTO ], "

13,16,171,DAWN,"It's not everyday someone gets to battle against a Ditto, you know? "

13,16,173,ASH,That's what I call confidence! 
13,16,174,BROCK,"So, I'll referee, if you don't mind. What kind of Pokémon do you have, Rissa? "
13,16,175,NARISSA,"You see, Ditto One and Two are my whole life! They're my pals and I'm theirs, twenty-four seven! "

13,16,243,ASH,"Okay, so how're you going to get me back? "
13,16,244,NARISSA,Man... the other day both my Ditto transformed into Zapdos and won and that makes Ditto the strongest Pokémon ever ! 
13,16,245,ASH,"Wow, they both did ...and won? "
13,16,246,NARISSA,Yeah! They sure did! 
13,16,247,BROCK,"So you were actually having a Battle at the time, right? "
13,16,248,NARISSA,It didn't even get that far! One look at two Zapdos and they were out of there! 
13,16,249,DAWN,But that means you didn't actually b*at them then...

13,16,253,NARISSA,But... me study? 
13,16,254,BROCK,"Look. Ditto can transform into any Pokémon, but as their Trainer, if you don't know the moves of the Pokémon they transform into then you won't be able to give your Ditto effective commands! "
13,16,255,NARISSA,What do you know? 
13,16,256,BROCK,Rissa! 
13,16,257,BROCK,"Unless you come to grips with what I'm saying, you'll never grow as a Trainer! "

13,16,264,"ASH, BROCK, DAWN",You lied? 
13,16,265,NARISSA,"Back home, I was just about as scared as I could be. I felt too scared to be just who I was so I dressed up like Flint! The truth is, I always admired the Elite Four and I wanted to look as tough as I could! "
13,16,266,"ASH, DAWN",Of course! 
13,16,267,DAWN,"Now that you mention it, your hairstyle and outfit look exactly like Flint's! "
13,16,268,NARISSA,So now... what do I do? 
13,16,269,BROCK,You just have to take it easy and learn everything you can about different Pokémon... 
13,16,270,BROCK,"See, Ditto can copy the moves of other Pokémon, but there's no way they can copy their power! If they're going into battle, you'll need to get them into shape! "
13,16,271,NARISSA,Right! 
13,16,272,ASH,"You know, you're actually kind of nice! "
13,16,273,NARISSA,"That's the thing... I am nice! But the truth is, I'm nothing but a big crybaby... "
13,16,274,BROCK,Don't worry! 
13,16,275,BROCK,"All you have to do is study and work hard, and you and your Ditto can grow together! "
13,16,276,NARISSA,"Wow! Please Brock, won't you work with my Ditto and me? "
13,16,277,BROCK,Sure! I'd be happy to! 
13,16,278,BROCK,"First, let's review your Battle from earlier... "
13,16,279,NARISSA,Right! 
13,16,280,BROCK,"Your first opponent was Infernape: a Fire type. Ditto also transformed into an Infernape, but in this case, Fire-type moves aren't really that effective! "
13,16,281,NARISSA,Right! 
13,16,282,BROCK,"So, if Ditto had transformed into Piplup instead, Ditto would have been able to use its Water-type moves, which would have been super-effective! "
13,16,283,NARISSA,I get it! 
13,16,284,BROCK,"Your next opponent was Pikachu. If you look up its moves in the Pokédex, you'll see that Ash's Pikachu knows more than just Electric-type moves, such as Iron Tail, which is a Steel-type move... and Quick att*ck, which is a Normal-type move! "
13,16,285,NARISSA,Question! Why does a Pokémon know moves from types other than theirs? 
13,16,286,BROCK,A great question! The answer is type advantage plays a huge role in a Pokémon Battle. That's why Trainers have their Pokémon learn moves from types other than their own! 
13,16,287,NARISSA,This is great stuff! 
13,16,288,"PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[PLEASED] 
13,16,289,BROCK,"Knowing the kind of moves a Pokémon uses and what kind of effect it has depending on type, you'll end up gaining a decisive advantage when having a Battle! "
13,16,290,NARISSA,Right! 
13,16,291,BROCK,Now let's level you up! And the only way to do that is to get experience from battling! My Happiny here will be your opponent! 
13,16,292,NARISSA,"Right! Ditto One and Ditto Two, Transform now! "
13,16,293,"DITTO , DITTO ",[TRANSFORM MOVE] 
13,16,294,BROCK,"Rissa, make your move and Happiny will take them both! "
13,16,295,NARISSA,"Right! Now Ditto One and Two, use Pound! HAPPINY [DITTO ], "
13,16,296,HAPPINY [DITTO ],[POUND MOVE] 
13,16,297,HAPPINY,[DISCONCERTED]

13,16,301,NARISSA,Ditto! 
13,16,302,BROCK,What? Oh no! 
13,16,303,ASH,Man Happiny is strong! 
13,16,304,DAWN,It's like an expl*si*n of Pokémon! 
13,16,305,BROCK,My Sudowoodo will be your opponent next... 
13,16,306,NARISSA,"Right! Okay Ditto One and Two, Transform now! "
13,16,307,"DITTO  , DITTO ",[TRANSFORM MOVE] 
13,16,308,BROCK,"You need to either dodge your opponent's move, or block it instead and use your own move! Those are the basics of the Battle! "
13,16,309,NARISSA,Right! 
13,16,310,BROCK,So try attacking together one more time! 
13,16,311,NARISSA,"Right! Ditto One and Two, use Hammer Arm! SUDOWOODO [DITTO ], "
13,16,312,SUDOWOODO [DITTO ],[HAMMER ARM MOVE] 
13,16,313,SUDOWOODO,[EXERTION] 
13,16,314,BROCK,"All right, now it's our turn! Give them a double sh*t of Hammer Arm! "
13,16,315,SUDOWOODO,"[HAMMER ARM MOVE] SUDOWOODO [DITTO ], "
13,16,316,SUDOWOODO [DITTO ],[BLOCKING] 
13,16,317,NARISSA,Keep blocking! You can do it!

13,16,354,MEOWTH,"Normally my eyeballs work perfectly, but this is just whack! "
13,16,355,JAMES,We could just ship all three to the Boss and be done with the lot... 
13,16,356,JESSIE,"Excuse me, Señor Selfish! Wobbuffet happens to be my Pokémon! "
13,16,357,STARAPTOR,[URGENT] 
13,16,358,ASH,"All right Team Rocket, there you are! "

13,15,30,JESSIE,Simple? You calling me simple?! Careful. 
13,15,31,MEOWTH,Time out! I think it's a good idea to keep in mind that the Twerpette gave you the ribbon that's getting you in through the Grand Festival front door! 
13,15,32,JAMES,"True, true! The upshot is you actually lost your battle against said Togekiss. You might even go so far as to say you're in Togekiss' debt for experiential services rendered! - "
13,15,33,JESSIE,All the more reason! - 
13,15,34,MEOWTH,For what?

13,15,141,GIBLE,[DISAPPOINTED] 
13,15,142,TOGEKISS,[SIGH] 
13,15,143,BROCK,"Togekiss is carefree, but it's tough as well! "
13,15,144,DAWN,"Like a big sister, don't you think? "
13,15,145,BROCK,Yeah! 
13,15,146,ASH,"Gible, that was great! You deserve a good rest! "
13,15,147,GIBLE,[PLEASED] 
13,15,148,ASH,"You were something, Togekiss. Wow! "
13,15,149,TOGEKISS,[PLEASED] 
13,15,150,PIKACHU,[HAPPY] 
13,15,151,DAWN,"Thank you for protecting Piplup, too! "
13,15,152,PIPLUP,[GRATEFUL] 
13,15,153,TOGEKISS,[GRACIOUS] 
13,15,154,TOGEKISS,[CURIOUS] 
13,15,155,"TOGEKISS, PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[MUNCHING] 
13,15,156,ASH,"Dawn, what's wrong? "
13,15,157,"TOGEKISS, PIPLUP",[FRIENDLY] 
13,15,158,DAWN,"I'm glad Togekiss helped Piplup, but... "
13,15,159,DAWN,I'm thinking I really don't understand Togekiss all that well. 
13,15,160,ASH,You don't? 
13,15,161,ASH,"I'll tell you, Togekiss sure impressed me! "
13,15,162,DAWN,"I guess you're right, but... I'm still confused. "
13,15,163,BROCK,I know what Dawn means. 
13,15,164,BROCK,Togekiss did that loop right before the Sky att*ck. 
13,15,165,BROCK,And took a long time before the Aura Sphere as well. 
13,15,166,BROCK,It was like Togekiss was trying to look good before launching all of those att*cks! 
13,15,167,ASH,"Yeah! Come to think of it, you're right! "
13,15,168,DAWN,"With all that beautiful flying, there's no doubt in my mind that Togekiss will do really well in the first round on the Performance Stage! But after that... who knows? "
13,15,169,BROCK,"With so much time between your command and Togekiss using the move, it's not going to be easy to battle. "
13,15,170,BROCK,But look at it another way. 
13,15,171,BROCK,"You and Togekiss are brand new to each other. Once you're communicating better, I'm sure everything will turn out just fine. "
13,15,172,DAWN,"Brock, I sure hope you're right. "
13,15,173,ASH,"Hey! You've got plenty of time to get this all squared away! You just keep on with your training, and I'm sure it'll all work itself out! "
13,15,174,BROCK,"Yeah, Ash is right! "
13,15,175,DAWN,Okay! 
13,15,176,"JESSIE, JAMES , MEOWTH",Ta-daa! 
13,15,177,MEOWTH,"Whenever times get tough, time for simple stuff, you dig? "
13,15,178,JESSIE,"And simply put, while the Twerps break for lunch, we'll dig it! "
13,15,179,JAMES,Shoveling our way to steal some success! 
13,15,180,"JESSIE, JAMES , MEOWTH",Yes! 
13,15,181,MEOWTH,Almost there! 
13,15,182,MEOWTH,Twerps totally targeted!

13,15,194,BROCK,Togekiss is really great at taking care of all the little ones! 
13,15,195,DAWN,"Togekiss, time to come down soon, okay? "
13,15,196,"TOGEKISS, PIPLUP, PIKACHU",[NOTICING] 
13,15,197,"PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[WORRIED]

13,15,201,DAWN,Now! Time for more Training! 
13,15,202,TOGEKISS,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,15,203,TOGEKISS,[SWEET] 
13,15,204,BROCK,That's it! 
13,15,205,BROCK,"Remember, Togekiss was raised by Princess Salvia. "
13,15,206,BROCK,"Which is why it's second nature to show off that grace! In a battle situation, it may look like unnecessary movement, but it's simply part of Togekiss's upbringing. "
13,15,207,ASH,Wow. So that's why working with Togekiss has been such a difficult thing for Dawn! 
13,15,208,DAWN,"Yeah, but we'll never be able to win a battle in that case! "
13,15,209,TOGEKISS,[PROUD] 
13,15,210,DAWN,"Now, Togekiss, please. You know speed and timing are crucial in a battle, right? "
13,15,211,TOGEKISS,[AFFIRMING] 
13,15,212,ASH,"Dawn, just train hard! "
13,15,213,BROCK,No need to worry! 
13,15,214,PIKACHU,[AGREEING] 
13,15,215,PIPLUP,[REASSURING] 
13,15,216,DAWN,"You're right. Okay, let's try one more time! "
13,15,217,TOGEKISS,[EXCITED] 
13,15,218,JAMES,Second time's the charm! 
13,15,219,MEOWTH,This dig for sure! 
13,15,220,JESSIE,"So drill, digger. "
13,15,221,ASH,Man! What was that blast? 
13,15,222,JESSIE,Blast? Don't use a loaded word like that! 
13,15,223,"JAMES , MEOWTH",Foul! 
13,15,224,"ASH, DAWN, BROCK",Team Rocket? 
13,15,225,JESSIE,"We just drilled ourselves Twerp-side, brainiac! "
13,15,226,MEOWTH,How am I supposed to aim in that washout? 
13,15,227,JAMES,Curses! No shovel means no shoveling! 
13,15,228,JESSIE,Stop! Enough groveling! Time to rely on team tenacity! 
13,15,229,ASH,What're you talking about? 
13,15,230,JESSIE,We want the world and we want it now!

13,15,237,JESSIE,A rose by any other name's just as sweet! 
13,15,238,JAMES,"When everything's worse, our work is complete! - "
13,15,239,JESSIE,Jessie! - 
13,15,240,JAMES,And James! 
13,15,241,MEOWTH,"Meowth, that's a name! "
13,15,242,JESSIE,Putting the do-gooders in their place! Cause we are Team Rocket. 
13,15,243,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",And we're in your face! 
13,15,244,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,15,245,JESSIE,"Look, Twerpette! I know you're at wit's end. So prepare to have your Togekiss taken off of your witless hands! "

13,15,393,DAWN,Togekiss showed me how best to use those graceful skills. 
13,15,394,BROCK,So that's how it happened! 
13,15,395,DAWN,"Togekiss has a unique way of doing things. But, I think the problem was I didn't realize that until now! "

13,14,68,ROLAND,Pokémon? I've got me a Magby! 
13,14,69,DAWN,"Magby, huh? "
13,14,70,ROLAND,Magby's cool all right. 
13,14,71,POKEDEX,Magby. The Live Coal Pokémon. Magby has a magma-like substance in its body and emits super-fiery breath. 
13,14,72,DAWN,Can I see? 
13,14,73,ASH,I want to see too! 
13,14,74,ROLAND,I just left Magby at Pokémon Day Care. They're gonna evolve my Magby in two hours flat! 
13,14,75,ASH,Two hours flat? 
13,14,76,DAWN,Can they even promise that? 
13,14,77,BROCK,Sounds strange to me. 
13,14,78,DAWN,You sure the Day Care center's here? 
13,14,79,ROLAND,I'm positive! They had a big billboard out front that said Mime Jr. Day Care! 
13,14,80,BROCK,Sounds fishy to me. 
13,14,81,ASH,"Yeah? Well, we're gonna find out what's up. "
13,14,82,ROLAND,Guess I'll have to let Bertha know right away. 
13,14,83,BROCK,Let Bertha know? 
13,14,84,ROLAND,"Yeah! You see, Bertha knows everything there is to know about Pokémon. "
13,14,85,BERTHA,"And what are you up to, Roland? "

13,14,95,BERTHA,That's right. I am. 
13,14,96,BERTHA,"But, I don't like to be called one of the Elite Four. At all. It's a secret! "
13,14,97,BROCK,"Yes, ma'am! "
13,14,98,BERTHA,"Roland! It's time for your Pokémon training! Now, I told you to hurry it up, so what in the world's taking so long? "
13,14,99,ROLAND,"You see, somebody stole my Magby. "
13,14,100,BERTHA,"Stole your Magby? Oh land sakes Roland, what am I going to do with you? "
13,14,101,BROCK,Is this your grandson? 
13,14,102,BERTHA,"Child of a cousin. Roland says he wants to get better at Pokémon battles, so I was asked to look after him. "
13,14,103,BERTHA,"If I told you once, I told you a thousand times: Once you have a Pokémon, you have a responsibility to watch over that Pokémon day in and day out. "
13,14,104,ROLAND,Right. 
13,14,105,BERTHA,"Now, how could you let that happen? I feel sorry for poor Magby! "
13,14,106,BROCK,"And of course, that's why you're one of the Elite... "
13,14,107,BERTHA,Now Roland! You must get Magby back. You have to learn to correct your own mistakes! You owe Magby that much at least! 
13,14,108,ROLAND,I will! 
13,14,109,ASH,All right! We'll help too! 
13,14,110,PIKACHU,[ENTHUSIASTIC]

13,14,113,ASH,I've got seven Gym Badges so far! 
13,14,114,DAWN,"And I'm on my way to compete in the Grand Festival, right now! "
13,14,115,BERTHA,So that means I'll get a chance to see how strong you both are! 
13,14,116,ASH,What do you mean how strong we are? 
13,14,117,BERTHA,You'll see. Have you figured out how you'll search for Magby yet? 
13,14,118,ASH,"Wow, to tell the truth... "
13,14,119,DAWN,We're kind of clueless. 
13,14,120,BROCK,The only thing we know for sure is there were three people involved in the theft. 
13,14,121,ROLAND,"So, what do we do? "
13,14,122,BERTHA,"While we're having this nice little talk, they might get away. "
13,14,123,"ROLAND, ASH, DAWN, BROCK, PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[WORRIED] 
13,14,124,ASH,That building's got an observatory! We can see the whole town from there.

13,14,367,BERTHA,"Ash, I told you once before! You need to strengthen your powers of observation! "
13,14,368,DAWN,There's that phrase again. 
13,14,369,BERTHA,"You should heed my words as well, young lady, since it will assist you in your Pokémon Contests! "
13,14,370,BERTHA,"Observe not only your own Pokémon, but your opponent's Pokémon too! How much do you really know about them? "
13,14,371,BERTHA,It boils down to your powers of observation! 
13,14,372,BERTHA,How much damage has your Pokémon taken? Can they continue battling? 
13,14,373,BERTHA,What moves are effective on your opponent? 
13,14,374,BERTHA,"In contests, too. "
13,14,375,BERTHA,Watch as many Pokémon moves as you can. Try them out and increase the variety of moves you already have. 
13,14,376,BERTHA,But of course battles and contests aren't the only chance you've got to sharpen up your skills. It's important to work those skills on a daily basis. 
13,14,377,DAWN,That must be how you knew that Team Rocket was hiding behind that one windmill! 
13,14,378,BERTHA,"That's right, dear. Now try those observation skills. "

13,14,383,BERTHA,"You see? In a Pokémon Battle, you have to be able to make the quick decisions! "
13,14,384,ASH,"All right, where? Where's it coming up next? "
13,14,385,ASH,When Hippowdon comes out of the ground... 
13,14,386,ASH,I can figure out Hippowdon's position when I see the rocks move! 
13,14,387,ASH,Observation... 
13,14,388,ASH,I'm an observer!

13,14,423,ASH,"Bertha, thank you! So, do you think I can win the Sinnoh League? "
13,14,424,BERTHA,"I guess you won't know until you give it a try, will you? "
13,14,425,BERTHA,"Whatever, it all depends on you developing those powers of observation, right? "
13,14,426,ASH,Right!

13,13,70,ROLAND,Magby's cool all right. 
13,13,71,POKEDEX,Magby. The Live Coal Pokémon. Magby has a magma-like substance in its body and emits super-fiery breath. 
13,13,72,DAWN,Can I see? 
13,13,73,ASH,I want to see too! 
13,13,74,ROLAND,I just left Magby at Pokémon Day Care. They're gonna evolve my Magby in two hours flat! 
13,13,75,ASH,Two hours flat? 
13,13,76,DAWN,Can they even promise that? 
13,13,77,BROCK,Sounds strange to me. 
13,13,78,DAWN,You sure the Day Care center's here? 
13,13,79,ROLAND,I'm positive! They had a big billboard out front that said Mime Jr. Day Care! 
13,13,80,BROCK,Sounds fishy to me. 
13,13,81,ASH,"Yeah? Well, we're gonna find out what's up. "
13,13,82,ROLAND,Guess I'll have to let Bertha know right away. 
13,13,83,BROCK,Let Bertha know? 
13,13,84,ROLAND,"Yeah! You see, Bertha knows everything there is to know about Pokémon. "
13,13,85,BERTHA,"And what are you up to, Roland? "

13,13,95,BERTHA,That's right. I am. 
13,13,96,BERTHA,"But, I don't like to be called one of the Elite Four. At all. It's a secret! "
13,13,97,BROCK,"Yes, ma'am! "
13,13,98,BERTHA,"Roland! It's time for your Pokémon training! Now, I told you to hurry it up, so what in the world's taking so long? "
13,13,99,ROLAND,"You see, somebody stole my Magby. "
13,13,100,BERTHA,"Stole your Magby? Oh land sakes Roland, what am I going to do with you? "
13,13,101,BROCK,Is this your grandson? 
13,13,102,BERTHA,"Child of a cousin. Roland says he wants to get better at Pokémon battles, so I was asked to look after him. "
13,13,103,BERTHA,"If I told you once, I told you a thousand times: Once you have a Pokémon, you have a responsibility to watch over that Pokémon day in and day out. "
13,13,104,ROLAND,Right. 
13,13,105,BERTHA,"Now, how could you let that happen? I feel sorry for poor Magby! "
13,13,106,BROCK,"And of course, that's why you're one of the Elite... "
13,13,107,BERTHA,Now Roland! You must get Magby back. You have to learn to correct your own mistakes! You owe Magby that much at least! 
13,13,108,ROLAND,I will! 
13,13,109,ASH,All right! We'll help too! 
13,13,110,PIKACHU,[ENTHUSIASTIC]

13,13,113,ASH,I've got seven Gym Badges so far! 
13,13,114,DAWN,"And I'm on my way to compete in the Grand Festival, right now! "
13,13,115,BERTHA,So that means I'll get a chance to see how strong you both are! 
13,13,116,ASH,What do you mean how strong we are? 
13,13,117,BERTHA,You'll see. Have you figured out how you'll search for Magby yet? 
13,13,118,ASH,"Wow, to tell the truth... "
13,13,119,DAWN,We're kind of clueless. 
13,13,120,BROCK,The only thing we know for sure is there were three people involved in the theft. 
13,13,121,ROLAND,"So, what do we do? "
13,13,122,BERTHA,"While we're having this nice little talk, they might get away. "
13,13,123,"ROLAND, ASH, DAWN, BROCK, PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[WORRIED]

13,13,194,ASH,I'll have to think about that. 
13,13,195,JAMES,The odds of the Twerps finding us in here are zilch!

13,12,64,DAWN,Ranger Sign? 
13,12,65,BEN,The Ranger Sign is a way of summoning Pokémon that I've bonded with in the past. I just use my Capture Styler! I can't believe it! It's not there! My Capture Styler is missing! What am I gonna do?

13,12,69,DAWN,A Heatran? 
13,12,70,POKEDEX,Heatran. The Lava Dome Pokémon. Heatran lives in volcanic caves and uses its cross-shaped claws to maneuver across stone walls. 
13,12,71,ASH,How come? Is something wrong? 
13,12,72,BEN,"Well, I discovered a special Heatran that can use Eruption. "
13,12,73,DAWN,Special? 
13,12,74,BROCK,A normal Heatran can't learn Eruption. 
13,12,75,DAWN,That's amazing! 
13,12,76,BEN,I was so close to bringing that Heatran back to the National Park when I lost sight of it!

13,12,92,JESSIE,We were so close to taking ownership of that Heatran. 
13,12,93,JAMES,"Ah, if only to be given a second chance to catch that scampering scamp. "
13,12,94,MEOWTH,"Yeah, fat chance. "
13,12,95,MEOWTH,Hey! Look over there! 
13,12,96,JESSIE,Wasn't the Pokémon Ranger carrying that thing? 
13,12,97,JAMES,That's a Capture Styler! It allows one to capture Pokémon and control them at will! 
13,12,98,JESSIE,"Well, our fugitive Heatran's a Pokémon, is it not? "
13,12,99,JAMES,Signs point to yes. 
13,12,100,MEOWTH,Yeah! So if we used this baby to capture Heatran and bring it to the Boss... 
13,12,101,MEOWTH,"I'll tell you, everything tastes much better when it's cooked using Heatran heat! "
13,12,102,MEOWTH,And there's nothing more relaxing than a Heatran sauna! 
13,12,103,MEOWTH,"'Course,eating the old mansion with Heatran power allows me to go green and save green as well! "
13,12,104,MEOWTH,"You know, Meowth and friends deserve some serious green for giving me such a thoughtful and rocking gift! "
13,12,105,MEOWTH,His gifts rock! 
13,12,106,"JAMES, JESSIE","No wonder we're smiling, 'cause soon we'll be styling, and be rich "
13,12,107,JESSIE,"And we won't have to match wits with those tacky Twerps! Though I only use half my wits, to keep it fair. "
13,12,108,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,12,109,BEN,The Heatran must be nearby! I feel it! 
13,12,110,DAWN,"But really, how can you be so sure? "
13,12,111,BEN,"Don't worry. So long as we keep moving, we're bound to find it. "
13,12,112,BROCK,"You're always looking at the bright side of things, so what's your secret? "
13,12,113,BEN,I always remember the motto that's been in my family for generations! 
13,12,114,ASH,A motto? 
13,12,115,BEN,Right! 
13,12,116,BEN,I was actually the most negative kid you'd ever want to meet. 
13,12,117,BEN,"When faced with an obstacle, no matter how small, I'd always give up! "
13,12,118,BEN,"But when I was down, my grandfather always said: "
13,12,119,BEN,"""Remember, son, it's always better to try than to cry!"" Great words to live by. "
13,12,120,ASH,But what did he mean by that? 
13,12,121,BEN,"You can either try and get things done or sit around complaining, but not both! "
13,12,122,BEN,"You know! If you don't succeed, try, try again! "
13,12,123,BEN,"So now, no matter what happens, I know that so long as I keep trying, things will work out! "
13,12,124,ASH,Makes sense. 
13,12,125,DAWN,"But if you're gonna find Heatran, you must have a plan. "
13,12,126,BEN,I sure do! 
13,12,127,ASH,"Hey, what're you doing? "
13,12,128,PIKACHU,[CONFUSED] 
13,12,129,BEN,Checking the temperature of the ground. 
13,12,130,ASH,But why? 
13,12,131,BEN,"Heatran always live near volcanoes, so it stands to reason that it would be somewhere where the ground feels warm to the touch. "
13,12,132,ASH,"Wow, that makes sense to me. "
13,12,133,DAWN,That's why you're a Pokémon Ranger! 
13,12,134,BROCK,"Wow, your knowledge of Pokémon is huge! "
13,12,135,BEN,Yeah! Now we're getting somewhere. 
13,12,136,BEN,Hmm. Warmer... 
13,12,137,BEN,The ground's especially warm around here! 
13,12,138,BROCK,"It could have something to do with the flow of magma, right? "
13,12,139,ASH,Awesome! Let's check it out! 
13,12,140,BEN,Right! 
13,12,141,MEOWTH,Give me a break! Mixing Twerps with a Pokémon Ranger could make this Pokémon sick! 
13,12,142,JAMES,"Still, if the Ranger's nearby, that could mean Heatran's nearby, true? "
13,12,143,JESSIE,"Think of it! We could conveniently use that captured Capture Styler to capture Heatran and Pikachu, true? "
13,12,144,"MEOWTH, JAMES",Yay! 
13,12,145,BEN,"The ground temperature's really rising now, just like I thought! "
13,12,146,MEOWTH,It's more fun giving a hotfoot than getting one! 
13,12,147,BROCK,That's strange. Up there! 
13,12,148,"PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[CURIOUS] 
13,12,149,ASH,Whoa! 
13,12,150,BROCK,It's like a lake of lava! 
13,12,151,ASH,Yeah! 
13,12,152,DAWN,Look up there! 
13,12,153,ASH,It's Heatran! 
13,12,154,PIPLUP,[CURIOUS] 
13,12,155,HEATRAN,[FOCUSED] 
13,12,156,BEN,"That's its special Ability, Flash Fire! Heatran's absorbing all of the heat from the magma flow. "
13,12,157,DAWN,"I'm glad we found it, but what are you gonna do now? "
13,12,158,BEN,"I could catch it, if I only had my Styler. "
13,12,159,ASH,So why don't you just catch Heatran with a Poké Ball? 
13,12,160,BEN,That's out of the question! 
13,12,161,BEN,A major part of my mission is to make sure Heatran's brought back to the National Park completely untouched! 
13,12,162,BEN,Of all the bad times to lose my Capture Styler. 
13,12,163,BEN,"Well, why cry over spilt milk? "
13,12,164,BEN,Better to try than cry! 
13,12,165,DAWN,The master of bouncing back! 
13,12,166,BEN,Let's go! 
13,12,167,BROCK,"I admire your optimism, but that's dangerous! "
13,12,168,BEN,Never say never! Onward and upward! 
13,12,169,BEN,What's that? 
13,12,170,BEN,A Diglett? What is going on here? 
13,12,171,JESSIE,"It's a Robo-Diglett, thank you very much. "
13,12,172,JAMES,Guess the optimist's out of touch! 
13,12,173,JESSIE,On the wind! 
13,12,174,JAMES,Past the stars! 
13,12,175,MEOWTH,Winning in the clutch! 
13,12,176,JESSIE,Bringing chaos at a breakneck pace! 
13,12,177,JAMES,"Dashing hope, putting fear in its place! "
13,12,178,JESSIE,A rose by any other name's just as sweet! 
13,12,179,JAMES,"When everything's worse, our work is complete! - "
13,12,180,JESSIE,It's Jessie! - 
13,12,181,JAMES,And James! 
13,12,182,MEOWTH,"Meowth, that's a name! "
13,12,183,JESSIE,Putting the do-gooders in their places! 
13,12,184,JAMES,We're Team Rocket! 
13,12,185,"JAMES, JESSIE, MEOWTH",In your faces! 
13,12,186,BEN,Team Rocket? 
13,12,187,ASH,"See, they're a bunch of guys with one job and one job only! "
13,12,188,BEN,Is it to protect peace and justice? For people and Pokémon? 
13,12,189,"BROCK, DAWN, PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[SHEEPISH] 
13,12,190,ASH,"Nah, Team Rocket's job is to steal people's Pokémon. "
13,12,191,ASH,What do you want this time? 
13,12,192,PIKACHU,[ANGRY] 
13,12,193,JESSIE,"We'll be taking the heat with Heatran, man! "
13,12,194,MEOWTH,"And we've got just the super-cool toy to do it with, dig? "
13,12,195,JAMES,Feast your eyes! 
13,12,196,BEN,"Hey, how did you get a hold of my Styler? "
13,12,197,BEN,"Hey, how did you get a hold of my Styler? "
13,12,198,JAMES,"No, my Styler! Prepare yourself, Heatran, to hang upon my every word! "
13,12,199,JESSIE,Yes! Yes! Yes! 
13,12,200,JAMES,A Styler with style! Capture on! 
13,12,201,MEOWTH,Your style's a big zero. 
13,12,202,JESSIE,What's with the dud? 
13,12,203,BEN,Did you think that was going to work for you? 
13,12,204,BEN,"I'm the only one who can use that Styler! Besides that, if you really want to capture a Pokémon, you've got to bond with it! "
13,12,205,JAMES,"Oh drat, and it looks so cool. "
13,12,206,BEN,Now give it back! 
13,12,207,JAMES,Take it! And it doesn't look cool! 
13,12,208,MEOWTH,"Stop, stooge! "
13,12,209,MEOWTH,"If you give it back, he's just gonna capture Heatran! "
13,12,210,JAMES,"Right! Point well taken, I must say. "
13,12,211,JESSIE,"Let's do this the old-fashioned way! Meowth, please! "
13,12,212,MEOWTH,With ease! 
13,12,213,MEOWTH,"When it comes to spinning a mean web, we're the b*mb! "
13,12,214,MEOWTH,Try and stay calm! 
13,12,215,HEATRAN,[ERUPTION MOVE] 
13,12,216,BEN,That was Heatran's Eruption! 
13,12,217,HEATRAN,[WORRIED] 
13,12,218,BEN,Heatran's in trouble! 
13,12,219,ASH,"Hold on! Ben, what're you doing? "
13,12,220,BEN,"This whole area's gonna collapse any minute! I'm getting my Styler back and getting Heatran out of here, quick! "
13,12,221,DAWN,Ben! But that's a lava pool! 
13,12,222,DAWN,This is crazy! 
13,12,223,BROCK,We need ice and water to cool things down! 
13,12,224,ASH,"Right, Brock! "
13,12,225,DAWN,"Let's cool where he's standing first, Piplup! Use Whirlpool, now! "
13,12,226,PIPLUP,[WHIRLPOOL MOVE] 
13,12,227,DAWN,That'll do it! 
13,12,228,PIPLUP,[DETERMINED] 
13,12,229,PIKACHU,[DETERMINED] 
13,12,230,ASH,All right! -

13,12,232,DAWN,Buneary! 
13,12,233,BUIZEL,[APPEARING] 
13,12,234,ASH,"Buizel, use Water g*n! "
13,12,235,DAWN,"Piplup, use Whirlpool! Buneary, Ice Beam at the same time! "
13,12,236,BUNEARY,[att*ck] 
13,12,237,BEN,"Wow, everybody, thanks! "
13,12,238,JAMES,"No fair, I want my Heatran! "
13,12,239,MEOWTH,'Kay! 
13,12,240,HEATRAN,[ERUPTION MOVE] 
13,12,241,JAMES,Curses! 
13,12,242,JESSIE,"Simply sic Robo-Diglett on that hothead, and capture it straight away! "
13,12,243,MEOWTH,"Whatever you say! Robo-Diglett, hey hey! "
13,12,244,MEOWTH,"Now, to get our big lug into capture mode! Hit the road! "
13,12,245,HEATRAN,[att*ck] 
13,12,246,MEOWTH,"Counterstrike, dude! "
13,12,247,BEN,That wall won't hold! 
13,12,248,JESSIE,That's how it's done! 
13,12,249,JAMES,What fun! 
13,12,250,BEN,Give it back! 
13,12,251,JAMES,Get your capturing claws off of my Styler! 
13,12,252,BEN,"It's my Styler, you petty thieves! "
13,12,253,BEN,Good! 
13,12,254,JAMES,Not good! 
13,12,255,MEOWTH,"Use that Styler, and Heatran goes back to you, and that won't do! "
13,12,256,JESSIE,Enough of you! 
13,12,257,JAMES,And checkmate! 
13,12,258,JESSIE,Pass the Styler if you don't want to swim in that hot soup! 
13,12,259,ASH,"Quick, Pikachu, use Thunderbolt! "
13,12,260,PIKACHU,[THUNDERBOLT MOVE] 
13,12,261,ASH,"All's clear, Ben! "
13,12,262,BEN,"All right! Thanks, Ash! "
13,12,263,BEN,That Robo-Diglett's out of control! 
13,12,264,HEATRAN,[ERUPTION MOVE] 
13,12,265,HEATRAN,[WORRIED] 
13,12,266,BROCK,Heatran's in trouble!

13,12,269,FERALIGATR,[APPEARING] 
13,12,270,BEN,Feraligatr! I need your help again! 
13,12,271,HEATRAN,[WORRIED]

13,12,273,FERALIGATR,[ICE BEAM MOVE] 
13,12,274,HEATRAN,[WORRIED] 
13,12,275,HEATRAN,[RELIEVED] 
13,12,276,BEN,"Feraligatr, thanks a lot! "
13,12,277,FERALIGATR,[PLEASED] 
13,12,278,JESSIE,"Oh, my head. "
13,12,279,MEOWTH,Not exactly peace and justice down here. 
13,12,280,JAMES,"Hey, what's with the raining rocks? "
13,12,281,JESSIE,I don't want to stick around and find out! 
13,12,282,MEOWTH,"So, let's quit while we're ahead, like grown-ups! "
13,12,283,JAMES,Mature words to live by! 
13,12,284,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",Aye! 
13,12,285,JESSIE,Buh-bye! - 
13,12,286,JAMES,Buh-bye!  -

13,12,292,BEN,It's dangerous here! You've got to listen to me! 
13,12,293,BEN,"I'm going to take you to the National Park, where it's safe! "
13,12,294,BEN,Capture on! 
13,12,295,BEN,"Capture complete! Heatran! Come with me, NOW! "

13,12,302,BEN,Requesting helicopter for transport! 
13,12,303,TEAM MEMBER A,Roger that! 
13,12,304,DAWN,I can't believe you managed to rescue Heatran from a bad situation like that. 
13,12,305,PIPLUP,[IMPRESSED] 
13,12,306,BROCK,"From now on, I'm gonna remember your motto all the time. "
13,12,307,ASH,"Yeah, me too! "
13,12,308,PIKACHU,[AGREEMENT] 
13,12,309,BEN,"Well, one thing's for sure, and that's that I couldn't have done it without all of you! "
13,12,310,BEN,"Thanks for everything, Ash. "
13,12,311,ASH,Now you remember to keep on working hard to help people and Pokémon everywhere! 
13,12,312,BEN,Right! You can count on me! 
13,12,313,BEN,"I'm a Pokémon Ranger! I've got one job, and you hit it on the head: protecting peace and justice for people and Pokémon! "
13,12,314,DAWN,That's an optimist for you. 
13,12,315,BROCK,You bet! 
13,12,316,"ASH, BROCK, PIKACHU",[CURIOUS] 
13,12,317,ASH,It looks like Ben's helicopter's here!

13,11,3,PIPLUP,[PROUD] 
13,11,4,NARRATOR,Dawn and Ash are finding the forest a perfect place for some valuable training. 
13,11,5,NARRATOR,"As Ash prepares for his upcoming Gym battle against Volkner, Dawn prepares for the Grand Festival, as Brock keeps a watchful eye on both. "
13,11,6,BROCK,That hard work's building an appetite. I think some chilled berries as part of a tasty dessert are sure to hit the spot for those Pokémon! 
13,11,7,BROCK,A boat? 
13,11,8,BROCK,Hello? Excuse me! 
13,11,9,BROCK,"Miss, you've got to wake up! Come on! "

13,11,23,ASH,Are you okay? 
13,11,24,BROCK,I guess I'm all right.

13,11,32,BROCK,"Don't worry, it's right there! "
13,11,33,MARLEY,Thank goodness. So why are you all wet? 
13,11,34,ASH,You were about to go over a waterfall! 
13,11,35,DAWN,So Brock's wet because he jumped into the river to save you! 
13,11,36,MARLEY,Oh. Then that means your name is Brock? 
13,11,37,ASH,Name? Wait a sec! 
13,11,38,DAWN,I would think you should at least thank him! 
13,11,39,BROCK,It's fine! I'm just glad that you're all right! 
13,11,40,MARLEY,My name is Marley. Who are you? 
13,11,41,ASH,"Uh, hi. My name's Ash, and this is Pikachu. "

13,11,45,BROCK,Why were you sleeping in a boat? 
13,11,46,MARLEY,I was hiding and must have fallen asleep by accident. 
13,11,47,ASH,You were hiding? 
13,11,48,DAWN,Hiding from what? 
13,11,49,MARLEY,There is a group of very bad people after me. 
13,11,50,"ASH, DAWN, PIPLUP, PIKACHU",[ALARMED] 
13,11,51,MARLEY,"You'll protect me, won't you please, Brock? - "
13,11,52,BROCK,Protect you? - 
13,11,53,MARLEY,"Protect me, yes. I have to travel to the other side of that mountain. "
13,11,54,MARLEY,"You'll take me, won't you? "
13,11,55,ASH,What are you talking about? 
13,11,56,DAWN,You can't expect us just to say yes. 
13,11,57,MARLEY,"Excuse me, I'm not asking you two. "
13,11,58,ASH,What was that?! 
13,11,59,MARLEY,"Please, Brock, let's go. "
13,11,60,ASH,"What's there to think about, Brock? "
13,11,61,DAWN,She'll be fine if she goes there by herself. 
13,11,62,BROCK,"But if Marley's being chased by bad people, and we were planning to go over that mountain anyway, then why not help her, too? "
13,11,63,MARLEY,Then it's settled. 
13,11,64,DAWN,There she goes again. 
13,11,65,BROCK,I agree. Let's go together! 
13,11,66,MARLEY,Good. 
13,11,67,"ASH, DAWN, PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[UNCOMFORTABLE] 
13,11,68,BROCK,So where are you headed after you cross that mountain? 
13,11,69,MARLEY,To a very secret garden. 
13,11,70,ASH,Secret garden? What's that? 
13,11,71,MARLEY,I can't say any more than that. 
13,11,72,ASH,"Oh, man. "
13,11,73,DAWN,Why are all these bad people after you? 
13,11,74,MARLEY,It's because I'm an alien. 
13,11,75,DAWN,An alien? - 
13,11,76,ASH,"You're kidding, right?  - "
13,11,77,MARLEY,I'm kidding.

13,11,86,BROCK,I have some Pokémon food I made earlier. 
13,11,87,MARLEY,"Please, Brock, I am in a rush. "
13,11,88,BROCK,Now just a sec. It won't take long! 
13,11,89,"PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[EXCITED] 
13,11,90,MARLEY,I'm going for a walk. 
13,11,91,BROCK,"Don't walk too far, okay? "
13,11,92,MARLEY,You can come out now. 
13,11,93,SHAYMIN,[WEAK] 
13,11,94,MARLEY,You have got to be starving. It's Pokémon food. Eat it! 
13,11,95,SHAYMIN,[SAD] 
13,11,96,MARLEY,But you've got to eat! You haven't had a thing all day. 
13,11,97,SHAYMIN,[WEAK] 
13,11,98,ASH,She's been gone a while. 
13,11,99,DAWN,Wonder what she's up to. 
13,11,100,BROCK,Let's go look! 
13,11,101,SHAYMIN,[SAD] 
13,11,102,MARLEY,"Shaymin, hey, what's wrong? "
13,11,103,BROCK,Marley! 
13,11,104,"DAWN, BROCK, PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[SHOCKED] 
13,11,105,ASH,"Hey, it's a Shaymin! "
13,11,106,POKEDEX,"Shaymin. The Gratitude Pokémon. When the Gracidea flower is in bloom, its pollen allows Shaymin to change into its Sky Forme from its Land Forme. Shaymin also have a tendency to migrate. "
13,11,107,BROCK,That Shaymin looks awfully weak to me. 
13,11,108,MARLEY,It's been like this since this morning. 
13,11,109,BROCK,Why didn't you tell me sooner? Let me see! 
13,11,110,MARLEY,What's wrong? 
13,11,111,PIKACHU,[CONCERNED]  
13,11,112,PIPLUP,[CONCERNED] 
13,11,113,SHAYMIN,[COUGHING] 
13,11,114,BROCK,Okay. It appears to have been exposed to poison of some kind! - 
13,11,115,MARLEY,Poison?  - 
13,11,116,BROCK,"That's right. There's a move called Seed Flare that Shaymin can use, which will take polluted air and then purify it. I think some of that poison could still be in its body. "
13,11,117,MARLEY,"Now that I think about it, Shaymin absorbed a Seviper's Haze this morning. But what can we do? "
13,11,118,BROCK,I'll use a Pecha Berry. 
13,11,119,BROCK,This will rid Shaymin of any lingering toxins! 
13,11,120,BROCK,"Here, eat this! "
13,11,121,SHAYMIN,[CONTENT] 
13,11,122,SHAYMIN,[COUGHING] 
13,11,123,"ASH, DAWN",[STARTLED] 
13,11,124,BROCK,That's it! Now we'll use a Sitrus Berry! It'll help you get your strength back! 
13,11,125,SHAYMIN,[CONTENT] 
13,11,126,SHAYMIN,[ENERGETIC] - 
13,11,127,MARLEY,"Wow, Shaymin! - "
13,11,128,ASH,Awesome! 
13,11,129,DAWN,Shaymin looks so much better! 
13,11,130,BROCK,That's a relief. 
13,11,131,MARLEY,"You know, Brock, it's almost like you're Nurse Joy! "
13,11,132,ASH,"Well, that's because Brock wants to become the world's greatest Pokémon breeder! "
13,11,133,DAWN,But you're keeping Shaymin inside of a picnic basket. Why? 
13,11,134,MARLEY,"Sadly, I have to keep it hidden, since the bad people are all after Shaymin. "
13,11,135,JESSIE,"All the people in the world, and she had to get tight with the Twerps! "
13,11,136,MEOWTH,Dealing with those dopes definitely drags down our stealing style! 
13,11,137,JAMES,Team Rocket never gives up or in! No witless Twerp can come between our Shaymin and us! 
13,11,138,JESSIE,"After the all-nighter we just pulled, no doubt we've earned it. "
13,11,139,MEOWTH,"Oh yeah, and this all-nighter was a no-sleep safari. "
13,11,140,MEOWTH,Check out the walking shock of greenery. 
13,11,141,MEOWTH,What do you know? That green shock's a Shaymin! 
13,11,142,SHAYMIN,[ALERT] 
13,11,143,JAMES,Shaymin ranks high as a really rare primo Pokémon! 
13,11,144,JESSIE,Which ranks really high as a primo gift for the Boss! 
13,11,145,MEOWTH,Of course! 
13,11,146,"MEOWTH, JESSIE, JAMES",Yoohoo! 
13,11,147,SHAYMIN,[SCARED] 
13,11,148,MARLEY,Who are you? 
13,11,149,JESSIE,"A bad dream! Yanmega, use Sonic Boom! "
13,11,150,YANMEGA,[SONIC BOOM MOVE] 
13,11,151,"MARLEY, SHAYMIN",[SCARED] 
13,11,152,MARLEY,Are you all right? 
13,11,153,SHAYMIN,[REASSURING] 
13,11,154,JESSIE,"We've earned that Shaymin, so hands off! "
13,11,155,JAMES,It's finders keepers and losers losers. 
13,11,156,MARLEY,This Shaymin doesn't want to go with you. 
13,11,157,MEOWTH,Your ribbon's on too tight! 
13,11,158,MARLEY,"Who are you, anyway? "
13,11,159,JESSIE,The best! The crème de la crème! 
13,11,160,JAMES,"We're the best, while they're just them! "
13,11,161,JESSIE,On the wind! 
13,11,162,JAMES,Past the stars! 
13,11,163,MEOWTH,I'm such a gem! 
13,11,164,JAMES,Vanishment! 
13,11,165,JESSIE,"Well, not for long! "
13,11,166,MARLEY,They're such bores! 
13,11,167,JESSIE,You've got the annoying traits of a Twerp! 
13,11,168,JAMES,Unacceptable! 
13,11,169,MARLEY,Arcanine! 
13,11,170,ARCANINE,[APPEARING] 
13,11,171,MARLEY,Use Flamethrower! 
13,11,172,ARCANINE,[FLAMETHROWER MOVE] 
13,11,173,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",We're blasting off again! 
13,11,174,JAMES,There isn't a blastoff big enough to banish Team Rocket. 
13,11,175,MEOWTH,There's a new and improved team sitting in our back pocket! 
13,11,176,JESSIE,And stealing Shaymin's the first thing on the docket! 
13,11,177,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,11,178,ASH,I get it. That's what happened. 
13,11,179,DAWN,So Shaymin's been with you ever since? 
13,11,180,MARLEY,"That's right. I tried once to say goodbye, but, well... "
13,11,181,MARLEY,"I know you go on a flower-bearing journey, isn't that right, Shaymin? If I remember correctly, the Gracidea flower garden is just past that mountain. "
13,11,182,SHAYMIN,[CURIOUS] 
13,11,183,MARLEY,"Yes, the flowers are all in bloom right now, so you better hurry. "
13,11,184,MARLEY,You should go. Or you won't make it in time. 
13,11,185,SHAYMIN,[SAD] 
13,11,186,MARLEY,"Later that night, I was having trouble falling asleep. "
13,11,187,MARLEY,Shaymin! 
13,11,188,SHAYMIN,[GREETING] 
13,11,189,SHAYMIN,[HAPPY] 
13,11,190,MARLEY,"All right, you win. We'll go to the Gracidea flower garden together, then. "
13,11,191,SHAYMIN,[PLEASED] 
13,11,192,MARLEY,"Wow Shaymin, you're so warm and cozy! "
13,11,193,SHAYMIN,[CONTENT]

13,11,195,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",Ta-da! 
13,11,196,MARLEY,Not you three again. 
13,11,197,JAMES,We've been foraging the forest for you all the livelong night! 
13,11,198,MEOWTH,"Hand over Shaymin, and we won't bite! "
13,11,199,MARLEY,I won't! Arcanine. 
13,11,200,JESSIE,"You lose!Seviper, use Haze, and make it hazy! "

13,11,209,ARCANINE,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,11,210,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",No! 
13,11,211,JAMES,Show yourself! 
13,11,212,JAMES,Not a trace! 
13,11,213,MEOWTH,She's gotta be in the forest! - 
13,11,214,JESSIE,To the forest!  - 
13,11,215,JAMES,The forest? 
13,11,216,JESSIE,The forest! 
13,11,217,DAWN,"Well, it all makes sense now. "
13,11,218,ASH,"But you don't have to worry about a thing anymore, 'cause you're with all of us! "

13,11,223,BROCK,Then let's go! 
13,11,224,JAMES,"They're headed to the Gracidea flower garden, as we thought! "
13,11,225,JESSIE,"And, surprise! We'll be there. "
13,11,226,MEOWTH,"When those dumb dopes get a load of the robot waiting for them, it'll knock that ribbon right off of that sleepy Twerpette's noggin! "

13,11,255,ASH,Hold on! 
13,11,256,ASH,We might be able to find a flower that's still blooming if we look! 
13,11,257,PIKACHU,[ENTHUSIASTIC] 
13,11,258,DAWN,I think we should all split up and do just that! 
13,11,259,PIPLUP,[ENTHUSIASTIC] 
13,11,260,ASH,There's got to be a blooming flower. 
13,11,261,DAWN,All we need is to find just one.

13,11,300,JAMES,It's our blockbuster Butterfree! 
13,11,301,JESSIE,"Since it's not really an Evolution, we've saved Maxi-Metapod for later! "
13,11,302,MEOWTH,So try our Robo-Hyper Solar Beam on for size!

13,11,331,MEOWTH,Right! Piece of cake!

13,10,16,JOHANNA,And it just so happens that I'm presenting a Coordinator class in this very town first thing tomorrow! 
13,10,17,DAWN,"Well, duh. Mom was a Top Coordinator, after all! "
13,10,18,PIPLUP,[PROUD] 
13,10,19,BROCK,So what exactly do you teach at this class? 
13,10,20,JOHANNA,This is the lesson plan. 
13,10,21,DAWN,Let me see! 
13,10,22,WAITER,"Excuse me, ma'am, you have a phone call. "
13,10,23,JOHANNA,Thanks! I'll be right back in a jif! 
13,10,24,ASH,Sure! 
13,10,25,ASH,"Don't hold out, Dawn, what's it say? "
13,10,26,DAWN,"""Getting to know Pokémon, and how to catch a Pokémon, and being a Coordinator, and how to breed Pokémon."" "
13,10,27,ASH,"Man, that stuff sounds great! "
13,10,28,DAWN,I'd love to check it out! You guys? 
13,10,29,ASH,You bet! 
13,10,30,BROCK,"Yeah, me, too! "
13,10,31,DAWN,"Hi, Mom... "
13,10,32,"ASH, BROCK, PIKACHU",[WORRIED] 
13,10,33,JOHANNA,A problem... 
13,10,34,DAWN,"What's the matter, Mom? "
13,10,35,JOHANNA,"There's going to be a Pokémon Contest tomorrow in Neighborly Town, right near here. But Nurse Joy is working round the clock caring for a sick Pokémon, so it appears that they're short one judge! "
13,10,36,DAWN,"Wait, does that mean... "
13,10,37,JOHANNA,"That's right, they want me to fill in as a judge at the contest. But my class is tomorrow. "
13,10,38,DAWN,"Mom, no need to worry! "
13,10,39,"ASH, BROCK, JOHANNA, PIKACHU",[SURPRISED] 
13,10,40,DAWN,We'll teach your students for you! 
13,10,41,ASH,Yeah! Of course we will! 
13,10,42,BROCK,I'll handle the breeding section! 
13,10,43,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
13,10,44,JOHANNA,"That would be wonderful, if you don't mind. "
13,10,45,ASH,We'll handle it! 
13,10,46,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
13,10,47,DAWN,"Good morning! My name is Dawn, and we're here today to teach the Pokémon Coordinator class for my mother!  "
13,10,48,PIPLUP,[GREETING] 
13,10,49,ASH,"My name's Ash, and this is my partner, Pikachu! "
13,10,50,PIKACHU,[GREETING] 
13,10,51,BROCK,"I'm Brock, and my goal is to be the top Pokémon breeder in the world! "
13,10,52,THOMAS,Come on. You sure you know what you're doing? Won any contest ribbons? 
13,10,53,DAWN,"Ta-da! Just take a look inside this case! I've won five contest ribbons, see? "
13,10,54,ASH,And me? I've got seven badges so far! 
13,10,55,"GIRL, BOY",Wow! 
13,10,56,THOMAS,'Course that means you're missing a badge. 
13,10,57,ASH,I guess you could look at it that way... 
13,10,58,DAWN,All righty then. Let's pet and get to know some Pokémon! 
13,10,59,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
13,10,60,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
13,10,61,THOMAS,Please! You can't go anywhere without finding tons of Pokémon! 
13,10,62,BOY,I can't believe how soft its fur is! 
13,10,63,GIRL,"Nice to meet you, Piplup! "
13,10,64,PIPLUP,[HAPPY] 
13,10,65,PIPLUP,[FRIENDLY] 
13,10,66,PIPLUP,[UPSET] 
13,10,67,PIPLUP,[ANGRY] 
13,10,68,DAWN,That's no way to treat a Pokémon! You have to try and be nice to them instead! 
13,10,69,DAWN,So what's your name? - 
13,10,70,THOMAS,Thomas. - 
13,10,71,DAWN,"So, Thomas, put yourself in the Pokémon's position. You wouldn't want to be teased, now would you? Same goes for Pokémon. "
13,10,72,THOMAS,"All right, I hear you... "
13,10,73,ASH,"I know! Guys, I think you should get to meet a lot more Pokémon... "
13,10,74,DAWN,"Great idea! Okay, how about we bring out a bunch of our Pokémon? "
13,10,75,"HAPPINY, SUDOWOODO, CROAGUNK, STARAPTOR",[APPEARING] 
13,10,76,"TORTERRA, INFERNAPE, BUIZEL, GIBLE",[APPEARING] 
13,10,77,"PACHIRISU, CYNDAQUIL, BUNEARY, MAMOSWINE",[APPEARING] 
13,10,78,DAWN,That's more like it! 
13,10,79,DAWN,"So let's get to know some Pokémon! But be nice to them, okay? "
13,10,80,"GIRL X , BOY X ",Okay! 
13,10,81,MARIAN,The excitement at the Neighborly Town Pokémon Contest is real and growing! Our next Coordinator is none other than the entertaining and unpredictable Jessilina! 
13,10,82,JESSILINA,"And don't forget gorgeous! All right, Seviper, Rocket Start! "
13,10,83,SEVIPER,[APPEARING] 
13,10,84,JESSILINA,"On a roll like this, I'll soon be experiencing fourth-ribbon bliss! "
13,10,85,MEOWTH,"If Jessie were any more pumped up, she'd spring a leak! "
13,10,86,JAMES,It'll be raining a fourth ribbon soon. 
13,10,87,JESSILINA,You're so right! 
13,10,88,BROCK,"Pokémon breeding is all about taking the best care of your Pokémon that you possibly can, making sure they're happy and healthy! "
13,10,89,PIPLUP,[RELAXED] 
13,10,90,BOY A,"Wow, you feed them Pokémon food, right, Brock? "
13,10,91,BROCK,Right! But giving your Pokémon Pokémon food is just one part of the process! Breeders adjust the diet and flavor for each one! 
13,10,92,HAPPINY,[HAPPY] 
13,10,93,BROCK,"If you find they aren't eating enough, you simply change things around a bit! By doing that, you maintain your Pokémon's good health! "
13,10,94,GIRL C,"So then, how do you tell if a Pokémon's healthy or not? "
13,10,95,BROCK,"The easiest way is to check their luster, and if their body isn't as smooth or healthy-looking as you'd like, it could be a sign that they might not be feeling very well. "
13,10,96,BOY A,What about them? 
13,10,97,BROCK,"They're healthy, because they're looking great! "
13,10,98,PIPLUP,[ANGRY] 
13,10,99,THOMAS,"You've got to admit, Piplup, your face looks a whole lot better now! "
13,10,100,PIPLUP,[ANGRY] 
13,10,101,PIPLUP,[ANGRY] 
13,10,102,THOMAS,Piplup's got a mustache! 
13,10,103,DAWN,'Course it would be Thomas. 
13,10,104,ASH,Piplup's having a bad day! 
13,10,105,KRABBY,[CURIOUS] 
13,10,106,ASH,"And then, my Pikachu and Gible battled with each other, but I just couldn't catch Gible at the time! After that, Gible followed us. Hold on... did I really catch Gible? Well, anyway, Gible and I are together, and that's what really matters! Isn't that right, Gible? "
13,10,107,GIBLE,[AFFECTIONATE] 
13,10,108,ASH,"Okay, Gible, return! "
13,10,109,ASH,And check this. This is a Poké Ball! 
13,10,110,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
13,10,111,ASH,"After you have a Pokémon battle with them, you use this to catch them! "
13,10,112,THOMAS,No big deal! All Trainers have at least one of those! 
13,10,113,ASH,"Well, I guess you're right! "
13,10,114,DAWN,So why don't we all get practicing? 
13,10,115,ASH,Good idea! Now... Let's pretend that target mark's a Pokémon and try to hit it! 
13,10,116,BOY A,"I want to, I want to! "
13,10,117,ASH,Yeah? Cool! Okay... Let's use this rubber ball for practice! 
13,10,118,BOY A,Right! 
13,10,119,"PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[EXERTION] / [HAPPY] 
13,10,120,ASH,"And you'll pick them up! Now, give it a sh*t! "
13,10,121,BOY A,"And, go! "
13,10,122,PIPLUP,[CURIOUS] 
13,10,123,PIKACHU,[HAPPY] 
13,10,124,BOY A,"Whoa, I missed! Man, this is hard! "
13,10,125,ASH,"Keep practicing, and you'll be able to hit it! - "
13,10,126,ASH,Who's next?  -
13,10,127,GIRL C,Me... Me! 
13,10,128,ASH,Here you go! Good luck! 
13,10,129,GIRL,"And here's the windup, and...go! "
13,10,130,PIPLUP,[HAPPY] 
13,10,131,ASH,"Man, you almost had it! "
13,10,132,GIRL C,"Oh, well... "
13,10,133,ASH,"Okay, I'll show you how it's done! See, you've got to pose like this first! "
13,10,134,DAWN,You don't really have to pose before you throw it. 
13,10,135,BROCK,Nope. Ash is pumped up. You know what that's about! 
13,10,136,ASH,This is how you toss it... 
13,10,137,"BOY X , GIRL X ",Awesome! 
13,10,138,DAWN,And that's how you catch a Pokémon! 
13,10,139,ASH,"Then! You make a final pose! ""I caught a Pokémon!"" "
13,10,140,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
13,10,141,THOMAS,That's easy! Man! 
13,10,142,"ASH, PIKACHU",[RESIGNED] 
13,10,143,ASH,"Thomas, why don't you give it a try? "
13,10,144,PIKACHU,[FRIENDLY] 
13,10,145,THOMAS,Go! 
13,10,146,PIPLUP,[PAINED] 
13,10,147,"ASH, DAWN, GIRL X , BOY X , PIKACHU",[SHOCKED] 
13,10,148,PIPLUP,[ANGRY] 
13,10,149,DAWN,"Thomas, no! "
13,10,150,THOMAS,"Hey, don't get mad at me, since you told me to throw it! "
13,10,151,ASH,"Thomas sure loves to joke around, doesn't he? "
13,10,152,BROCK,But why tease just Piplup? 
13,10,153,"THOMAS, BOY X , GIRL X ",Time to eat! 
13,10,154,BOY,Wow! Yummy! 
13,10,155,BROCK,Thank you! 
13,10,156,DAWN,"Brock has got to be the greatest chef in the world! Thomas, how is it? "
13,10,157,THOMAS,"Uh, it's okay. "
13,10,158,"DAWN, BROCK","Well, isn't that... nice! "
13,10,159,DAWN,"Brock made a whole bunch, so have as much as you like! "
13,10,160,"BOY X , GIRL X ",Yay! 
13,10,161,JESSILINA,"One more round to go, and this baby is mine! "
13,10,162,JAMES,Our jumping Jessie is on fire! 
13,10,163,MEOWTH,"Yeah, Jess is on a slow roast to victory! "
13,10,164,ASH,"So get ready, Dawn, you're up next! The next class is for Coordinators! "
13,10,165,BROCK,"Hey, what's wrong, Dawn? "
13,10,166,DAWN,"I'm worried about Thomas, that's what's wrong! I just hope I'll do a good job. "
13,10,167,ASH,"Hey, Thomas just likes to pull practical jokes. No need to worry. You're fine! "
13,10,168,DAWN,I hope you're right. 
13,10,169,BROCK,"Dawn, just do your best, and you'll be okay! "
13,10,170,DAWN,Maybe... 
13,10,171,DAWN,"All right, everybody. A Pokémon Contest has two rounds: the Performance Stage and the Contest Battle. A Coordinator needs to decide what kind of performance style they're going to use and what moves they'll be using as well. Your Pokémon is always the focus. Everybody with me? "
13,10,172,"BOY X , GIRL X ",Yeah! 
13,10,173,DAWN,Round One's where a Coordinator shows off their Pokémon. See? 
13,10,174,THOMAS,"Sorry, but I don't have a clue what you're talking about. "
13,10,175,THOMAS,"Say exactly what you mean, okay? "
13,10,176,DAWN,"Ah, uh... You show off your Pokémon's cuteness, how's that? "
13,10,177,THOMAS,"Pokémon's cuteness? Yeah, right. "
13,10,178,DAWN,This will be much faster if I just show you! 
13,10,179,"MAMOSWINE, CYNDAQUIL",[APPEARING] 
13,10,180,DAWN,"All right, watch closely! "
13,10,181,DAWN,Now! I'll show you what a combination looks like! 
13,10,182,DAWN,"Cyndaquil, use Flame Wheel! "
13,10,183,CYNDAQUIL,[FLAME WHEEL MOVE] 
13,10,184,DAWN,"Mamoswine, use Ice Shard! "
13,10,185,MAMOSWINE,[ICE SHARD MOVE] 
13,10,186,BOY A,Awesome! 
13,10,187,BOY B,Pretty! 
13,10,188,DAWN,"I call this Flame Ice, because it's a flame in ice! "
13,10,189,CYNDAQUIL,[PROUD] 
13,10,190,MAMOSWINE,[PROUD] 
13,10,191,DAWN,"Thomas, how's that? "
13,10,192,THOMAS,It's all right. 
13,10,193,DAWN,"Stubborn... okay! I'm going to use the same move, but with a different Pokémon this time! "
13,10,194,ASH,Different Pokémon? 
13,10,195,PIKACHU,[CURIOUS] 
13,10,196,BROCK,Hope it works. 
13,10,197,DAWN,"Cyndaquil, return! Pachirisu, come on out! Now! "
13,10,198,PACHIRISU,[APPEARING] 
13,10,199,DAWN,"Ta-da! This time it's Pachirisu! Cyndaquil's move was with fire, but this uses Pachirisu's electricity, which will make the ice sparkle! And... I call this move Ice Chandelier! "
13,10,200,"THOMAS, BOY X , GIRL X ",Ice Chandelier? 
13,10,201,"ASH, BROCK",Ice Chandelier? 
13,10,202,PIPLUP,[CONFUSED] 
13,10,203,DAWN,"Mamoswine, Ice Shard! "
13,10,204,MAMOSWINE,[ICE SHARD MOVE] 
13,10,205,DAWN,"Now, shatter it! "
13,10,206,MAMOSWINE,[DETERMINED] 
13,10,207,ASH,Whoa! Awesome! 
13,10,208,DAWN,"Pachirisu, Discharge! "
13,10,209,PACHIRISU,[DISCHARGE MOVE] 
13,10,210,DAWN,It worked! 
13,10,211,"BOY X , GIRL X ",Wow! 
13,10,212,PACHIRISU,[CONFUSED] 
13,10,213,"ASH, BROCK, PIKACHU",[SHOCKED] 
13,10,214,DAWN,What happened? 
13,10,215,THOMAS,"C'mon, that wasn't a finished move! "
13,10,216,THOMAS,"Besides, Pachirisu's totally standing still inside the ice! So it's boring to watch. "
13,10,217,DAWN,Guess maybe you're right. 
13,10,218,"BOY X , GIRL X , PIKACHU, PACHIRISU, MAMOSWINE",[PLAYFUL] 
13,10,219,ASH,"Hey, what's the matter, Dawn? "
13,10,220,DAWN,Thomas was right when he told me it's not a finished move yet. 
13,10,221,DAWN,"Hi, Brock! "
13,10,222,BROCK,Ice Chandelier isn't going to be an easy move to master. 
13,10,223,ASH,Yeah. Maybe you should start over and come up with a whole different combination! 
13,10,224,DAWN,"Yeah, except I really like Ice Chandelier and want to make it work! "
13,10,225,DAWN,I wonder if it can even be done! 
13,10,226,THOMAS,"Besides, Pachirisu's totally standing still inside the ice! "
13,10,227,DAWN,Of course! 
13,10,228,DAWN,Yes! I think I know how to make it work this time around! 
13,10,229,DAWN,"Okay, listen up! This is the real Ice Chandelier! "
13,10,230,DAWN,"First off, Mamoswine will shatter Ice Shard with its tusks. Next, the shattered Ice Shard will surround Pachirisu. "
13,10,231,THOMAS,"Oh, so it's just the same thing as before. "
13,10,232,DAWN,"This is where things change. Thomas, your comments turned out to be excellent advice! "
13,10,233,THOMAS,They did? 
13,10,234,DAWN,"Before, Pachirisu used Discharge while standing still. This time, Pachirisu is going to spin during Discharge. That way, the ice should sparkle more beautifully than you can imagine! No need to worry! Because I'm sure it'll work this time! "
13,10,235,ASH,Sounds good! It's worth a sh*t! 
13,10,236,BROCK,Yeah! Let's see how it turns out. 
13,10,237,DAWN,"Okay, Mamoswine! Use Ice Shard! "
13,10,238,MAMOSWINE,[ICE SHARD MOVE] 
13,10,239,PACHIRISU,[EXCITED] 
13,10,240,DAWN,"Mamoswine, shatter it with your tusks! "
13,10,241,MAMOSWINE,[DETERMINED] 
13,10,242,DAWN,Now for the show! 
13,10,243,DAWN,"Pachirisu, Discharge! "
13,10,244,PACHIRISU,[DISCHARGE MOVE] 
13,10,245,BOY B,It's Discharge! 
13,10,246,GIRL D,Think it'll be able to spin? 
13,10,247,DAWN,Spin right where you are! 
13,10,248,PACHIRISU,[EXERTION] 
13,10,249,DAWN,"Faster, Pachirisu! "
13,10,250,PACHIRISU,[DETERMINED] 
13,10,251,ASH,Looking good! 
13,10,252,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
13,10,253,PACHIRISU,[DAZED] 
13,10,254,DAWN,"Oh, no. "
13,10,255,ASH,"Man, that was close! "
13,10,256,BROCK,"You know, it's a good idea, but Pachirisu needs to be able to spin a little bit more for it to work! "
13,10,257,DAWN,You okay? 
13,10,258,PACHIRISU,[EXCITED] 
13,10,259,DAWN,And I was so confident it would work... Maybe spinning inside the ice isn't going to cut it! 
13,10,260,PACHIRISU,[EAGER] 
13,10,261,ASH,"You can do it, Dawn! Pachirisu's still pumped and raring to try it again! "
13,10,262,PACHIRISU,[EXCITED] 
13,10,263,DAWN,"Pachirisu, want to take another sh*t? "
13,10,264,THOMAS,Don't waste your time! 
13,10,265,THOMAS,"Come on now. Who wouldn't become dizzy from all that spinning? No matter what you try, it's useless! "
13,10,266,DAWN,"Thomas, you may be right. Of course! "
13,10,267,MARIAN,And she's done it again! The winner of the Neighborly Town Pokémon Contest is none other than Jessilina! 
13,10,268,MARIAN,"And now for a comment from the judges' table, please! "
13,10,269,JOHANNA,"Seviper's Haze was simply beautiful, and its execution of that Poison Tail was nothing less than exquisite! First rate! "
13,10,270,MEOWTH,And Jessie makes a slam dunk for ribbon number four! 
13,10,271,JAMES,Then to the Grand Festival with one more! 
13,10,272,"JAMES, MEOWTH, JESSILINA",A perfect score! 
13,10,273,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,10,274,DAWN,"Buneary, it's your turn! Go! "
13,10,275,BUNEARY,[APPEARING] 
13,10,276,ASH,You're using Buneary instead of Mamoswine? 
13,10,277,BROCK,What exactly are you up to? 
13,10,278,PIKACHU,[CURIOUS] 
13,10,279,DAWN,Just you watch! 
13,10,280,DAWN,"Buneary! Use Ice Beam and surround Pachirisu, now! "
13,10,281,BUNEARY,[ICE BEAM MOVE] 
13,10,282,DAWN,Use Ice Beam until a ball of ice forms around Pachirisu! 
13,10,283,BUNEARY,[ICE BEAM MOVE] 
13,10,284,THOMAS,Just like she said! 
13,10,285,PIPLUP,[AMAZED] 
13,10,286,ASH,What's Dawn trying to do? 
13,10,287,BROCK,"Of course! The air pocket in Mamoswine's Ice Shard was really small, so Pachirisu got dizzy from all that spinning while all it could do was spin! But now, with Buneary's Ice Beam surrounding Pachirisu, there's no need for Pachirisu to spin... Pachirisu can just run inside that ice sphere! "
13,10,288,ASH,"Dawn, that was good thinking! "
13,10,289,DAWN,"All right, Pachirisu, use Discharge while running! "
13,10,290,PACHIRISU,[DISCHARGE MOVE] 
13,10,291,THOMAS,"C'mon, you can do it, Pachirisu, all right! "
13,10,292,PACHIRISU,[DETERMINED] 
13,10,293,ASH,Go for it! 
13,10,294,BROCK,Just a little bit more! 
13,10,295,THOMAS,"Yeah, all right! "
13,10,296,PIPLUP,[CHEERING] 
13,10,297,DAWN,Do it! 
13,10,298,DAWN,That's it! 
13,10,299,GIRL C,Wow! 
13,10,300,GIRL D,Pretty! 
13,10,301,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
13,10,302,THOMAS,It worked! It worked! Amazing! Amazing! 
13,10,303,PIPLUP,[SURPRISED] 
13,10,304,ASH,She did it! 
13,10,305,PIKACHU,[AMAZED] 
13,10,306,BROCK,"Dawn tried but could never quite make it work using Ice Shard. By switching to Ice Beam, it works beautifully! "
13,10,307,PACHIRISU,[EXCITED] 
13,10,308,DAWN,"Pachirisu, we did it! "
13,10,309,PACHIRISU,[JOYFUL] 
13,10,310,DAWN,Buneary? Thanks so much! 
13,10,311,DAWN,"And thanks, Thomas. Where's Thomas? "
13,10,312,ASH,"Yeah, and where's Piplup? "
13,10,313,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
13,10,314,PIPLUP,[PLAYFUL] 
13,10,315,DAWN,What is going on with them? 
13,10,316,BROCK,That's what that was about! 
13,10,317,"ASH, DAWN, PIKACHU",[CONFUSED] 
13,10,318,BROCK,"Thomas must've really liked Piplup from the start but just didn't know how to say it! So in Thomas's frustration, the only thing he knew how to do instead was to tease it. "
13,10,319,ASH,Of course! 
13,10,320,PIKACHU,[SATISFIED] 
13,10,321,"THOMAS, PIPLUP",[PLAYFUL] 
13,10,322,DAWN,"Thomas, I want you to know that I mastered Ice Chandelier because of your advice. Thanks a lot! "
13,10,323,THOMAS,"I tell you, that Ice Chandelier of yours is really pretty! "
13,10,324,DAWN,You think so? 
13,10,325,THOMAS,It'll work great in the contest! 
13,10,326,DAWN,"Thanks, Thomas! I'll do my best! "
13,10,327,THOMAS,"Piplup, I'm so sorry I teased you like that... "
13,10,328,PIPLUP,[FRIENDLY] 
13,10,329,ASH,"How was the Neighborly Town Contest, Johanna? "
13,10,330,JOHANNA,I'm happy to report that Jessilina put on a really fantastic performance and ended up winning! 
13,10,331,DAWN,"That must mean Jessilina's working hard, too! "
13,10,332,JOHANNA,"And here's Neighborly Town's specialty, Neighborly sweet buns! "
13,10,333,BROCK,Wow! Thank you so much! 
13,10,334,JOHANNA,"So, Dawn, it sounds like you're getting really good at combinations! "
13,10,335,DAWN,Yup! 
13,10,336,JOHANNA,I'm so glad you're working hard! And thank you all for subbing for me in class today! You saved me! 
13,10,337,ASH,We had a great time! 
13,10,338,JOHANNA,"I've got something, Dawn... For you! "
13,10,339,DAWN,What's this? 
13,10,340,JOHANNA,"A brand-new dress for the Grand Festival, made by yours truly! "
13,10,341,DAWN,All right! 
13,10,342,JOHANNA,"Good luck, honey! - "
13,10,343,DAWN,"Oh, thank you, Mom! - "
13,10,344,JOHANNA,"And of course, lots of luck in your quest to earn your eighth badge, Ash. "
13,10,345,ASH,Thanks! I'll do my best! 
13,10,346,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
13,10,347,NARRATOR,"Teaching a beginning Pokémon class has given our heroes valuable experience, and one of their students helped Dawn perfect a new combination! Perfect timing, since the Grand Festival is right around the corner, as the adventure continues"
13,09,0,VOLKNER,"You were brilliant, Ash. All of your spark, and that of your Pokémon. Watching you battle inspired me more than I can say! "
13,09,1,ASH,Thanks! So does that mean you'll have a Gym battle with me? 
13,09,2,VOLKNER,Yes! And an electrifying one too! 
13,09,3,NARRATOR,"With his battle spark reignited, Volkner, leader of the Sunyshore Gym, accepts Ash's challenge! "
13,09,4,NARRATOR,"But will Ash successfully earn his eighth badge? Stay tuned for the answer, and the excitement! "
13,09,5,REFEREE MECH,"The battle between Ash, the challenger, and Volkner, the Gym Leader, will now get underway! "
13,09,6,REFEREE MECH,"Each side may use three Pokémon, and the match will be over when all three of either side's Pokémon are unable to battle! "
13,09,7,REFEREE MECH,"In addition, only the challenger will be allowed to substitute Pokémon. "
13,09,8,ASH,"Just think! If I win this battle, we're in the Sinnoh League! You ready, Pikachu? "
13,09,9,PIKACHU,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,09,10,REFEREE MECH,"And, begin! "
13,09,11,VOLKNER,"Go, Luxray! "
13,09,12,LUXRAY,[APPEARING] 
13,09,13,ASH,"Grotle, I choose you! "
13,09,14,GROTLE,[APPEARING] It's about you It's about me It's about hope It's about dreams It's about friends that work together To claim their destiny It's about reaching for the skies Pokemon! Given the courage And willing to try It's about never giving up So hold your head up And we will carry on... Sinnoh League Victors Pokemon! 
13,09,15,LUXRAY,[EXERTION] 
13,09,16,GROTLE,[EXERTION] 
13,09,17,BROCK,So that means Ash's putting his Grass-type Grotle up against Volkner's Electric-type Luxray! It looks like a clear case of matching by type. 
13,09,18,FLINT,"Yeah, but Volkner's strong! I just don't think type is going to be all that important! I'm so psyched! "
13,09,19,DAWN,"Ash, come on and show him what you've got! "
13,09,20,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
13,09,21,ASH,"All right Grotle, use Razor Leaf! "
13,09,22,GROTLE,[RAZOR LEAF MOVE] 
13,09,23,VOLKNER,"Luxray, dodge and use Spark! "
13,09,24,LUXRAY,[SPARK MOVE] 
13,09,25,GROTLE,[PAINED] 
13,09,26,ASH,Grotle! 
13,09,27,PIKACHU,[WORRIED] 
13,09,28,GROTLE,[STRUGGLING] / [DETERMINED] 
13,09,29,BROCK,Oh wow! That was some Spark. 
13,09,30,DAWN,"It sure was, but with Spark, I guess it was not very effective! "
13,09,31,PIPLUP,[IMPRESSED] 
13,09,32,FLINT,"Just wait! See, Volkner's only beginning to get warmed up! "
13,09,33,VOLKNER,"All right, Ash! Your next move? "
13,09,34,ASH,"Well, I knew it wasn't going to be easy... So, we'll just work harder! All right, Grotle, let's show them what we can do! "
13,09,35,GROTLE,[EXCITED] 
13,09,36,"ASH, PIKACHU, GROTLE",[SURPRISED] 
13,09,37,DAWN,What happened to the lights? 
13,09,38,PIPLUP,[WORRIED] 
13,09,39,ASH,"What's going on, Volkner? That's weird. "
13,09,40,PIKACHU,[CONFUSED] 
13,09,41,VOLKNER,"Not sure, I guess we're going to have to put our battle on hold until I figure this out! "
13,09,42,FLINT,Come on! Don't keep us waiting at a time like this! 
13,09,43,VOLKNER,"I'm doing all I can. All right, it looks like the Gym's been left completely without power! "
13,09,44,"VOLKNER, FLINT","One, two, go! "
13,09,45,FLINT,a*t*matic doors are a pain when they're not a*t*matic. 
13,09,46,JENNY,"Volkner, we've got problems!! "
13,09,47,BROCK,Wow! Officer Jenny! 
13,09,48,BROCK,I could never be without power when I gaze into your eyes! It's like... 
13,09,49,BROCK,...the opposite of this. 
13,09,50,VOLKNER,"Jenny, what's wrong? "
13,09,51,JENNY,I regret to inform you that all the power in Sunyshore City has been cut off! 
13,09,52,"ASH, DAWN, VOLKNER, PIPLUP, PIKACHU, RAICHU",[SHOCKED] 
13,09,53,FLINT,That's awful! 
13,09,54,VOLKNER,The thing is... Sunyshore City is run entirely on solar power! 
13,09,55,VOLKNER,"The solar panels, positioned everywhere, collect the sun's energy and send it to Sunyshore Tower, which then functions as a power plant for the entire city. "
13,09,56,VOLKNER,So that means something must have happened at Sunyshore Tower! 
13,09,57,VOLKNER,"I'll investigate. Raichu, quick! "
13,09,58,RAICHU,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,09,59,"BROCK, DAWN, ASH, JENNY, VOLKNER, FLINT",[SHOCKED] 
13,09,60,PIPLUP,[PANICKED] 
13,09,61,DAWN,Look! The tower! 
13,09,62,"BROCK, ASH, JENNY, VOLKNER, FLINT, PIPLUP",[SHOCKED] 
13,09,63,FLINT,"All right, what's going on here? "
13,09,64,JESSIE,Listen! To the wisdom from the top of the tower! 
13,09,65,JAMES,Our diabolical plan is beginning to flower! 
13,09,66,JESSIE,On the wind! 
13,09,67,JAMES,Past the stars! 
13,09,68,MEOWTH,Fight the power! 
13,09,69,JESSIE,There's no electricity over there. 
13,09,70,JAMES,And wouldn't you know? None over there! 
13,09,71,JESSIE,A black out by any other name's just as black! 
13,09,72,JAMES,"When it comes to chaos, we've got the knack! - "
13,09,73,JESSIE,Jessie! - 
13,09,74,JAMES,And James! 
13,09,75,MEOWTH,"Meowth, that's a name! "
13,09,76,"JAMES, MEOWTH",Dun dun dun dun dun daaaaah!

13,09,79,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",In your face! 
13,09,80,ASH,Team Rocket! 
13,09,81,PIKACHU,[ANGRY] 
13,09,82,VOLKNER,Team Rocket? 
13,09,83,BROCK,They're a group of thieves who steal other people's Pokémon! 
13,09,84,JESSIE,You lose! Correction! Stealing Pokémon is not on our agenda today! 
13,09,85,JAMES,"Nope! Rather, our current goal is tackling much more of a towering task! And I do mean towering! "
13,09,86,MEOWTH,I hope you heard that play on words! 'Cause when we take this tower you'll think we're the team of the hour! 
13,09,87,WOBBUFFET,[PROUD] 
13,09,88,VOLKNER,What was that? 
13,09,89,JENNY,So! That would lead me to believe that you're the ones who cut the power to the city! 
13,09,90,JESSIE,You were listening! You can hear and think! 
13,09,91,JAMES,We're stealing this tower of power and all of its perks! But we won't waste a watt so don't waste your time worrying your Twerpish heads! 
13,09,92,MEOWTH,'Cause tbaby's headed for headquarters stat! Gotta scat! 
13,09,93,"JENNY, VOLKNER, FLINT, ASH, DAWN, BROCK",[SHOCKED] 
13,09,94,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",Keep those towers rolling! 
13,09,95,"BROCK, DAWN, ASH, JENNY, VOLKNER, FLINT",[STRUGGLING] 
13,09,96,ASH,They burn me up! 
13,09,97,PIKACHU,[FURIOUS] 
13,09,98,VOLKNER,I will not let my tower wind up in the hands of criminals like them! 
13,09,99,VOLKNER,"Raichu, let's go! "
13,09,100,RAICHU,[DETERMINED] 
13,09,101,FLINT,I'm coming too! 
13,09,102,ASH,Me too! 
13,09,103,PIKACHU,[DETERMINED] 
13,09,104,PIPLUP,[DETERMINED] 
13,09,105,JENNY,But how? 
13,09,106,JOY,Officer Jenny! 
13,09,107,JENNY,Nurse Joy! 
13,09,108,JESSIE,"Feeling good, looking great and flying right! Let's high-tail it home to headquarters! "
13,09,109,MEOWTH,"And now that the Sunyshore Tower's going be known as the Team Rocket Tower, we'll finally have some practical power and real clout! Know what that means? "
13,09,110,JAMES,"Our floors will be so warm and toasty, the Boss will prefer to sleep here than at home in his own bed! And to satisfy his culinary urges, gourmet stoves to cook his latest creation! "
13,09,111,MEOWTH,And a hot water bathtub heater to soak away the stress of the day! Guess what he'll say. 
13,09,112,MEOWTH,"Thanks to Meowth and friends, my relaxation's a no-brainer and I'm using clean energy and saving the environment at the same time! "
13,09,113,MEOWTH,"If our future was any brighter, we'd need shades, baby! And we all know what that means, now don't we, my peeps? "
13,09,114,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",Climb the ladder of success! Leave the Twerps behind! 
13,09,115,WOBBUFFET,[EXCITED] 
13,09,116,"BROCK, DAWN, ASH, VOLKNER, FLINT, PIPLUP",[EXERTION] 
13,09,117,FLINT,What in the world are they going to do with Sunyshore Tower? 
13,09,118,RAICHU,[EXERTION]

13,09,123,JAMES,"Energy absorbers, normal! Power supply, normal! All systems ready for take off, stat! "
13,09,124,JESSIE,Excellent! Who needs help when we've got a rocket in our team pocket? 
13,09,125,WOBBUFFET,[HAPPY] 
13,09,126,MEOWTH,"Okey doke, it's time for the official countdown! "
13,09,127,MEOWTH,T-minus ten... nine... eight... seven... 
13,09,128,VOLKNER,"No, that rocket's going to take off! "
13,09,129,ASH,Not if I've got anything to say about it! 
13,09,130,MEOWTH,Three...two...one... blast off! 
13,09,131,VOLKNER,"Raichu, jump! "

13,09,136,"DAWN, BROCK, PIPLUP",[PANICKED] 
13,09,137,"DAWN, BROCK, PIPLUP",[PANICKED] 
13,09,138,JENNY,I don't get it! Why wouldn't the generator in the Pokémon Center be working either? 
13,09,139,JOY,Well I've got everyone in Sunyshore City working to bring it back online! 
13,09,140,JENNY,What's that? 
13,09,141,VOLKNER,"Ash, are you okay? "
13,09,142,ASH,I'm fine! 
13,09,143,FLINT,Good! Just make sure you keep moving. 
13,09,144,VOLKNER,"Flint, no! "
13,09,145,ASH,Flint! 
13,09,146,ASH,Flint! Oh no!

13,09,149,VOLKNER,"I'm going to pull you up, Ash! "
13,09,150,ASH,Volkner! 
13,09,151,RAICHU,[URGENT] 
13,09,152,ASH,"Thanks, Volkner! That was close! "
13,09,153,VOLKNER,"Yes, but you're okay now! Over there- I'm sure that's the service entrance. "
13,09,154,PIKACHU,[SHOCKED] 
13,09,155,VOLKNER,"I should know! I did build the thing after all! Ash, let's go! "
13,09,156,ASH,Right! 
13,09,157,FLINT,"Man, that was awful! "
13,09,158,BROCK,Flint! 
13,09,159,DAWN,Are you all right? 
13,09,160,PIPLUP,[CONCERNED] 
13,09,161,FLINT,"Yeah, I'm fine! "

13,09,165,PIKACHU,[CONCERNED] 
13,09,166,VOLKNER,He's a big boy! Don't worry about it. 
13,09,167,RAICHU,[REASSURING] 
13,09,168,VOLKNER,It looks like they've somehow rigged it to control the tower from the observatory... 
13,09,169,"ASH, VOLKNER, PIKACHU, RAICHU",[PANICKED] 
13,09,170,"ASH, VOLKNER, PIKACHU, RAICHU",[STRUGGLING]

13,09,172,JAMES,"Pure genius! No matter which tilt the tower takes, our seating stays straight! "
13,09,173,MEOWTH,Dig it! We got a million ways to use the groovy juice this airborne baby packs! 
13,09,174,JESSIE,"Plenty of pure power, a clean machine, and a safe sound strategy make a tip-top team! "

13,09,179,JOY,"Okay, everything's ready to go! "
13,09,180,BROCK,Yay! Nurse Joy! 
13,09,181,BROCK,"One look at you, and my power meter's on ten! You give me such a jolt! "

13,09,184,"JOY, JENNY, DAWN, FLINT, PIPLUP",[EMBARRASSED] 
13,09,185,JENNY,Thank you! Since the backup generator here at the Pokémon Center has broken down... 
13,09,186,JENNY,...they've been working non-stop to get it back online! 
13,09,187,JOY,"Unfortunately, there are a lot of Pokémon here that need serious care- and they can't afford to be without it much longer! "
13,09,188,JOY,Which leaves us with only one thing to do! 
13,09,189,DAWN,"What's that, Joy? "
13,09,190,PIPLUP,[CURIOUS] 
13,09,191,JENNY,We use these! 
13,09,192,FLINT,Got it! People power! Great idea! I like it! 
13,09,193,FLINT,"You may not know this, but I used to be quite the cyclist back when! All right! "
13,09,194,FLINT,"C'mon Brock, time to get with the program and grab a bike! "
13,09,195,BROCK,Huh? Sure! 
13,09,196,FLINT,It would help to pedal. 
13,09,197,BROCK,All right! 
13,09,198,JOY,"Wonderful! Thank you both! Now keep it up, boys! "
13,09,199,"BROCK, FLINT",You've got it!

13,09,202,VOLKNER,"Ash, I feel badly that our Gym battle was so rudely interrupted... Please forgive me! "
13,09,203,ASH,"Hey, no problem! We've gotta get the tower back, so don't worry about it! "
13,09,204,VOLKNER,Right! Our sunny shores must be protected! 
13,09,205,RAICHU,[FOCUSED] 
13,09,206,ASH,Is that where the name comes from? 
13,09,207,VOLKNER,You hit it right on the head! Sunyshore City is known for its bright sunlight. It's the perfect name for a perfect city! 
13,09,208,ASH,"So then, that must be why you built all the solar panels in Sunyshore Tower right? "
13,09,209,VOLKNER,That's right! The truth is Sunyshore Tower is what makes Sunyshore City. That's why I have to get it back! 
13,09,210,ASH,Got it! 
13,09,211,PIKACHU,[FOCUSED] 
13,09,212,BROCK,Man... 
13,09,213,BROCK,"I'm so tired, I can hardly move my feet! "
13,09,214,FLINT,That is unacceptable! Now show me some guts! 
13,09,215,BROCK,I'm fresh out of guts.

13,09,219,JOY,"You can do it! I believe in you, Brock! "
13,09,220,BROCK,Right! 
13,09,221,BROCK,"Yes, I shall pedal with every last ounce of strength I can muster up! "
13,09,222,FLINT,I like it! 
13,09,223,FLINT,Blow the top off that meter and don't stop pedaling until you do! 
13,09,224,VOLKNER,We can get to the observatory through here. 
13,09,225,VOLKNER,Ready to charge?

13,08,30,BROCK,"Of course! Otherwise, what's the point of having Gyms? "
13,08,31,DAWN,What did Paul say? 
13,08,32,PAUL,That Gym is not legit! 
13,08,33,DAWN,This must've been what Paul meant. 
13,08,34,ASH,I want to see Volkner now! I want to challenge that guy to a real Gym Battle! 
13,08,35,PA,That is not possible. 
13,08,36,ASH,"Volkner! C'mon, I know you're in there! Hey! "

13,08,64,FLINT,You've got a Gym Battle challenger! 
13,08,65,ASH,Hi! Nice to meet ya! I'm Ash! I wanna Gym Battle! 
13,08,66,VOLKNER,You saw the Badges at the Gym. Just take one of those. 
13,08,67,ASH,"No way! I want to earn my Badge by winning to Gym Battle! So please, let me challenge you to a Battle! "
13,08,68,PIKACHU,[URGENT] 
13,08,69,VOLKNER,Don't make me tell you again. 
13,08,70,ASH,But why won't you? 
13,08,71,VOLKNER,I've completely lost interest in battling. 
13,08,72,ASH,But 
13,08,73,FLINT,"Volkner, I can tell you Ash is an electrifying Trainer! And I'm sure if you just gave him a chance "
13,08,74,"ASH, PIKACHU",[SURPRISED] 
13,08,75,VOLKNER,What a day. Beautiful! I'd like you to leave. 
13,08,76,FLINT,Volkner! 
13,08,77,FLINT,"It's my treat! Drink up, folks! "
13,08,78,"BROCK, DAWN","Thanks so much, Flint! "
13,08,79,BROCK,Wow! What a fantastic deep and rich flavor! 
13,08,80,DAWN,And what an aroma! 
13,08,81,PROPRIETOR,"I'm so happy you feel that way! And, this is all on the house! "
13,08,82,DAWN,Oh yum! 
13,08,83,FLINT,"That's wonderful, thank you! "
13,08,84,"BROCK, DAWN","Thank you, sir! "
13,08,85,"PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[HAPPY][CHEERFUL] 
13,08,86,DAWN,Dee - lish! 
13,08,87,PIPLUP,[THRILLED] 
13,08,88,DAWN,"Why aren't you eating, Ash? "
13,08,89,ASH,"Okay, look Flint! I can't go along with this! When I heard Volkner was the strongest Gym Leader, well see, I got totally fired up! But I just can't believe how un-into battling Volkner is now. "
13,08,90,FLINT,Yeah. Believe me he wasn't always like this. 
13,08,91,PROPRIETOR,"Right. Everybody used to refer to Volkner as ""The Shining, Shocking Star."" "
13,08,92,ASH,You're kidding. 
13,08,93,FLINT,He reminded everyone of a bolt of lightning! Electrifying. 
13,08,94,FLINT,"Back when I was a kid, this city was full of hoodlums, but Chimchar and I fought our way right to the top! "
13,08,95,CHIMCHAR,[ATTACKING] 
13,08,96,CHIMCHAR,[SATISFIED] 
13,08,97,FLINT ,"Then one day, I met Volkner. I'll never forget it. Suddenly, as if it were fated, we had a Battle! "
13,08,98,CHIMCHAR,[ATTACKING] 
13,08,99,FLINT,And I won 
13,08,100,FLINT,"But, it wasn't long until Volkner challenged Chimchar and me once again! "
13,08,101,CHIMCHAR,[ATTACKING] 
13,08,102,PIKACHU,[ATTACKING] 
13,08,103,CHIMCHAR,[PAINED] 
13,08,104,FLINT,"And this time, Volkner won. "
13,08,105,FLINT,"After that, we battled day in and day out to see who was the top Trainer in Sunyshore City. "
13,08,106,DAWN,Wow! Did you guys battle that much because you didn't like each other? 
13,08,107,FLINT,"No, no! That wasn't why! "
13,08,108,PROPRIETOR,"Oh, they were getting along. I think they both knew they'd always get along no matter what. It's knowing that fact, that kept them going! "
13,08,109,FLINT,That changed when the two of us came across a rogue poacher deep in the forest 
13,08,110,PIKACHU,[ATTACKING] 
13,08,111,FLINT,"So, facing an opponent together for the first time, we battled alongside each other! "
13,08,112,FLINT,When it was over 
13,08,113,FLINT,"even though we did manage to chase the poacher away, it took its toll. Truth is, we got b*at up pretty badly. "
13,08,114,FLINT,"But it didn't matter if we got hurt! Because after that day, we were good friends. "
13,08,115,ASH,"But if Volkner's like what you say he is, why won't he Battle me? "
13,08,116,DAWN,Is there something else? 
13,08,117,PROPRIETOR,"I'll tell the rest of what happened. It was when Flint had just turned twenty. Volkner became the Gym Leader and stayed in Sunyshore City. And Flint, with a desire to gain greater strength and skills, went on the road, training in all conditions! "
13,08,118,PROPRIETOR,"Flint eventually became a member of the Elite Four, while Volkner started losing interest in battling the many Gym Challengers who crossed his path. He was always into technology, and soon became obsessed with it. "
13,08,119,PROPRIETOR,"He built solar-powered systems all over the city, and Sunyshore Tower as well, which controls these systems. When finished, he could control the entire city with solar-powered electricity! "
13,08,120,PROPRIETOR,"But after all was said and done, for some reason Volkner felt like an empty shell. Something was missing from his life. It's like everything had lost its meaning! "
13,08,121,FLINT,I brought you to Volkner because I thought you could help himyour spark could make him feel like new! 
13,08,122,VOLKNER,It was a wasted trip. 
13,08,123,FLINT,Volkner! How long have you been there? 
13,08,124,VOLKNER,"Give me the u - sual, please. "
13,08,125,PROPRIETOR,Sure. 
13,08,126,FLINT,"Volkner, you know how I feel about this! Come on, snap out of it! "
13,08,127,VOLKNER,"So did you come back here just to give me a lecture, Mr. Elite Four? "
13,08,128,FLINT,What did you say? 
13,08,129,VOLKNER,"If you wanna punch me, do it. "
13,08,130,FLINT,It's not even worth the time it takes to do it! 
13,08,131,FLINT,"So what's happened to you? What happened to the electrifying Volkner? ""The Shining, Shocking Star?"" "
13,08,132,VOLKNER,"Flint, we're not kids anymore. You've got to grow up sometime. - "
13,08,133,FLINT,Grow up? - 
13,08,134,PROPRIETOR,Flint! 
13,08,135,PROPRIETOR,Take a chance. Why don't you have that Battle with Ash? 
13,08,136,FLINT,Battle with Ash? Why would I do that? 
13,08,137,ASH,"C'mon, Flint! Have a Battle with me! "
13,08,138,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
13,08,139,BROCK,"It's not every day one battles with a member of the Elite Four, you know. "
13,08,140,DAWN,I'd love to see that! 
13,08,141,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
13,08,142,PROPRIETOR,"Volkner! You'll join us then, right? "
13,08,143,PROPRIETOR,"After all, Flint's battling Ash in your place. The least you could do is watch. "
13,08,144,VOLKNER,Sure! Whatever. 
13,08,145,PROPRIETOR,Then it's settled! 
13,08,146,JAMES,The Sunyshore Gym Fetching! 
13,08,147,JESSIE,"So, how do we go about fetching Pikachu? "
13,08,148,MEOWTH,Piece of cake I say we dig! 
13,08,149,"JAMES, JESSIE",That's our kind of gig! 
13,08,150,MEOWTH,"James, you're shedding! "
13,08,151,JAMES,My bottle cap! The rarest of the rare! 
13,08,152,CLEANING MECH,Trash identified. Disposing. 
13,08,153,JAMES,"That's not trash, that's treasure! You robotic brute! "
13,08,154,"JESSIE, MEOWTH, WOBBUFFET",[SURPRISED] 
13,08,155,REFEREE MECH,"Attention! The three-on-three Pokémon Battle between Flint of the Elite Four, and Ash from Pallet Town will now get underway! And, begin! "
13,08,156,FLINT,Ready or not! 
13,08,157,ASH,"So Flint's using Infernape! Okay, Buizel, I choose you! "
13,08,158,BUIZEL,[APPEARING] 
13,08,159,DAWN,"Flint's using a Fire type so Ash's got the advantage using Buizel, which is a Water type! "
13,08,160,BROCK,"Right! When it comes to type advantage, Buizel's moves are super-effective on Infernape and not very effective the other way around! "
13,08,161,PROPRIETOR,"Well, well! It's been a while since you've seen Flint in a Battle isn't that right? "
13,08,162,VOLKNER,I really don't care. 
13,08,163,ASH,"Buizel! Water g*n, let's go! "
13,08,164,BUIZEL,[WATER g*n MOVE] 
13,08,165,FLINT,"Dodge it, quick! "

13,07,129,JESSIE,"Out West, if a Pokémon has been cast aside by their Trainer, we are there! Quick as a flash, we locate that Trainer and attempt to talk sense into the misguided one! "
13,07,130,JAMES,"And out East, if there's been a mean-spirited Trainer who takes their Pokémon for granted, we're there as well! We go with that Pokémon and teach said Trainer exactly what they need to know to become a better Pokémon person! "
13,07,131,MEOWTH,"Down south, if there's a hungry Pokémon pathetically pining for some long-overdue grub, we are there! We deliver mountains or munchies! "
13,07,132,JESSIE,"And up north, if a Pokémon and its Trainer have had a bit of a tiff, we're there too! We listen to both sides and then advise them on making nice! "
13,07,133,JESSIE,Not even rain! 
13,07,134,MEOWTH,blustery wind! 
13,07,135,JAMES,or winter's chill can hold us back! That's the variety of reliable Rescue Corps we strive to be! 
13,07,136,PIPLUP,[UPSET] 
13,07,137,JESSIE,"Oh my, we've sprung a leak. "
13,07,138,MEOWTH,Piplup says we hit it where it hurts! 
13,07,139,JESSIE,"Right! It's a cold, cruel world out there! If a Pokémon doesn't rate "
13,07,140,JAMES,It's too late! 
13,07,141,JESSIE,And its Trainer may toss it like an old Pokémon newspaper! 
13,07,142,JAMES,The emotional wounds a tossed Pokémon can suffer can run deep! 
13,07,143,"JAMES,JESSIE,MEOWTH",Have no fear! Help is here! We'll dry each tear! 
13,07,144,PIPLUP,[UPSET] 
13,07,145,ASH,"Staraptor, did you see Piplup? "
13,07,146,STARAPTOR,[NEGATIVE] 
13,07,147,ASH,Guess Staraptor hasn't seen a thing. 
13,07,148,DAWN,So where could Piplup be? 
13,07,149,BROCK,There's no way Piplup could have gone that far. 
13,07,150,ASH,"Hey Gible, will you help us look too? "
13,07,151,GIBLE,[DETERMINED] 
13,07,152,GIBLE,[SEARCHING] 
13,07,153,GIBLE,[CHEWING] 
13,07,154,RHYPERIOR,[ANGRY] 
13,07,155,GIBLE,[SHOCKED] 
13,07,156,RHYPERIOR,[ATTACKING] 
13,07,157,GIBLE,[FRIGHTENED] 
13,07,158,RHYPERIOR,[ATTACKING] 
13,07,159,ASH,Okay what's a Rhyperior doing around here? 
13,07,160,POKEDEX,"Rhyperior. The Drill Pokémon, and the evolved form of Rhydon. Rhyperior can hurl rocks at its enemies by tightening its arm muscles and launching them from the holes in its palms. "
13,07,161,DAWN,We've got to get moving and find Piplup! 
13,07,162,ASH,"Gible, stop biting and let's get moving, c'mon! "
13,07,163,GIBLE,[CHOMPING] 
13,07,164,MEOWTH,So it sounds to me like you were looking to split the scene! Right Piplup palley? 
13,07,165,PIPLUP,[UPSET] 
13,07,166,MEOWTH,Piplup says it was planning on heading back to Professor Rowan's lab! 
13,07,167,JESSIE,Some walk! Do you know how far away that is? 
13,07,168,JAMES,You could be nursing a million heartaches and you'd still be walking! 
13,07,169,MEOWTH,Why split in the first place? 
13,07,170,PIPLUP,[SAD] 
13,07,171,PIPLUP,[CALM] 
13,07,172,MEOWTH,"Piplup says even though it was minding its own business and not doing anything wrong, Gible kept popping it on the head with Draco Meteor over and over. Ouch! "
13,07,173,PIPLUP,[AGHAST] 
13,07,174,MEOWTH,"And even with all those bops to the bean, Piplup's Trainer didn't even warn Gible once not to do it and Gible's Trainer didn't even get angry either-not a single time! "
13,07,175,PIPLUP,[UPSET] 
13,07,176,MEOWTH,"When Piplup finally piped up and said something to Gible, all it got was the cold shoulder! "
13,07,177,PIPLUP,[SAD] 
13,07,178,MEOWTH,Everyone was sticking up for Gible and nobody cared about poor Piplup's feelings one bit! 
13,07,179,JAMES,"Oh, the agony! "
13,07,180,JESSIE,There's nothing quite as painful as when no one cares about your feelings. 
13,07,181,MEOWTH,This Piplup's a victim of total and complete Trainer to Pokémon neglect! 
13,07,182,JAMES,So making the long journey to Professor Rowan's lab seemed your only option! 
13,07,183,JESSIE,"And since our home office often doesn't even know who we are, we know just how you feel. "
13,07,184,JESSIE,Poor Piplup! 
13,07,185,PIPLUP,[SURPRISED] 
13,07,186,JESSIE,"No need for tears. From now on, we'll be your family! "
13,07,187,PIPLUP,[RELIEVED] 
13,07,188,JESSIE,"All right, Meowth and Piplup, wait here! "
13,07,189,JAMES,There's a little talk that needs to be talked! 
13,07,190,PIPLUP,[GRATEFUL] 
13,07,191,MEOWTH,I'll be bonding with my buddy here and working on good Pokémon etiquette! 
13,07,192,JESSIE,It's time we teach those clueless Twerps a lesson in manners for the sake of themselves and their Pokémon! 
13,07,193,JAMES,Right! Pokémon Appreciation will soon be in session! 
13,07,194,ASH,Well? Did you see Piplup? 
13,07,195,STARAPTOR,[DISAPPOINTED] 
13,07,196,ASH,"Okay, Staraptor, return! "
13,07,197,ASH,I wonder if Piplup's angry because Gible's Draco Meteor kept on hitting it from the sky the way it did... 
13,07,198,DAWN,"Yeah, it did happen more than once. "
13,07,199,JESSIE,May we have a word with you? 
13,07,200,"ASH, BROCK, DAWN, PIKACHU",[SURPRISED] 
13,07,201,DAWN,"Uh, who are you? "
13,07,202,JESSIE,Check the I.D. and you'll see we're members of the Pokémon Rescue Corps! 
13,07,203,BROCK,"Pokémon Rescue Corps, you're right! "
13,07,204,DAWN,So what exactly does your Corps do? 
13,07,205,JAMES,Our stated mission is to help out troubled Pokémon in need! 
13,07,206,JESSIE,And it just so happens that recently we were asked by a certain troubled Pokémon for our assistance! A Pokémon who was betrayed by its Trainer and her friends! 
13,07,207,JESSIE,"""And who's the Trainer?"" you ask? "
13,07,208,JESSIE,It was you! 
13,07,209,"ASH, PIKACHU",[SHOCKED] 
13,07,210,JESSIE,and you! 
13,07,211,JAMES,Our client emotionally stated that the Pokémon called Gible kept hitting it with a Draco Meteor square on its head! 
13,07,212,JESSIE,"And in spite of this shabby treatment, neither of you Trainers scolded Gible for being so uncaring! And furthermore, no one seemed to worry one bit about the victim named Piplup! "
13,07,213,PIKACHU,[WORRIED] 
13,07,214,"ASH, DAWN",Victim? 
13,07,215,JAMES,Do you have any idea how that can emotionally injure a Pokémon for life? 
13,07,216,JESSIE,The dear is devastated! 
13,07,217,DAWN,Oh no! 
13,07,218,JAMES,Don't you people know a whit about Pokémon and their care? 
13,07,219,JESSIE,The fact is a Pokémon is much more of a delicate creature than you think! 
13,07,220,ASH,"Hey, we already knew that! C'mon. "
13,07,221,"JESSIE, JAMES",Afraid not. 
13,07,222,JESSIE,"If you truly did know it, you wouldn't have acted that way! "
13,07,223,JAMES,A Pokémon's pain is its Trainer's pain! 
13,07,224,JESSIE,And a Pokémon's grief is its Trainer's grief! 
13,07,225,"JESSIE, JAMES",Welcome! To the basic relationship between Pokémon and Trainer! 
13,07,226,DAWN,But we feel the same way as you! 
13,07,227,JESSIE,No! Wrong answer! You made your very own Pokémon so sad that it ran away! 
13,07,228,"ASH, BROCK, DAWN, PIKACHU",[SHOCKED] 
13,07,229,DAWN,It did? 
13,07,230,JESSIE,Sad but true! We found the poor dear crying its eyes out and actually attempt - ing to make the journey to Professor Rowan's laboratory on foot! 
13,07,231,JESSIE,No Rescue Corps worth its weight in honor could stand to see poor Piplup treated like dirt! 
13,07,232,JAMES,When we gave assistance we heard its tale - and decided to give you a piece of our angry minds! 
13,07,233,"ASH, BROCK, DAWN, PIKACHU",[EMBARRASSED] 
13,07,234,JESSIE,"So because it is ever-so-clear you don't know the first thing about the care and feeding of Pokémon, we insist you participate in our special sensitivity class! "
13,07,235,JAMES,Right! And we'll take good care of your Pokémon while you're attending said class. Not that you would know anything about that! 
13,07,236,"JESSIE, JAMES","Now, if you will leave us your Poké Balls! "
13,07,237,ASH,What do you think? 
13,07,238,DAWN,Guess we've got no choice. 
13,07,239,RHYPERIOR,[ANGRY] 
13,07,240,"ASH, BROCK, DAWN, JAMES, JESSIE, PIKACHU",[SURPRISED][SURPRISED]

13,07,242,RHYPERIOR,[ATTACKING] 
13,07,243,"ASH, BROCK, DAWN, JAMES, JESSIE, PIKACHU",[PANICKED] [FRIGHTENED] 
13,07,244,BROCK,I guess we got separated from that Rescue Corps! 
13,07,245,DAWN,Do you really think what they were saying is true? 
13,07,246,ASH,"If so, we owe Piplup a big apology Where'd Pikachu go? "
13,07,247,DAWN,No! Not Pikachu too! 
13,07,248,JESSIE,Rhyperior's got issues! 
13,07,249,JESSIE,Fear not! We laid out your case! 
13,07,250,JAMES,And told them exactly of your feelings and fears! 
13,07,251,PIPLUP,[GRATEFUL] 
13,07,252,MEOWTH,Piplup says it doesn't know if it can ever thank you enough! 
13,07,253,JESSIE,"You don't have to thank us! See, rescuing is what a Rescue Corps is supposed to do and we love what we do! "
13,07,254,PIPLUP,[HAPPY] 
13,07,255,JESSIE,"But if gratefulness is grabbing at you, we do have just a few weensy things we would love to ask your dear pal Pikachu! There may be some concerns on little Pikachu's mind as well, of course. "
13,07,256,JAMES,"True! After all, you can't help too many Pokémon, right? Don't you think? "
13,07,257,PIPLUP,[PROUD] 
13,07,258,MEOWTH,"Piplup says ""Leave it to the master!"" "
13,07,259,PIPLUP,[DETERMINED] 
13,07,260,"JAMES, JESSIE, MEOWTH","See you soon, good buddy! "
13,07,261,JESSIE,How easy to handle can these simple-minded Twerp Pokémon be? 
13,07,262,JAMES,Very! 
13,07,263,PIKACHU,[WORRIED]

13,05,20,JESSILINA,"Then put your money where your surprise is! Yanmega, lift Seviper into the air! "
13,05,21,YANMEGA,[EXERTION] 
13,05,22,URSULA,Now use Helping Hand! 
13,05,23,"PLUSLE, MINUN",[HELPING HAND MOVE] 
13,05,24,MARIAN,Plusle and Minun are using Helping Hand on each other to power up! 
13,05,25,MARIAN,You've got to be impressed by their amazing performance! 
13,05,26,ASH,"Powering up, wow! "
13,05,27,BROCK,Helping Hand's a move that increases the strength of your partner's move. And by using it on each other they're earning something more- points for their cuteness! 
13,05,28,JESSILINA,"Seviper, use Poison Tail! Yanmega, Silver Wind! "
13,05,29,"SEVIPER, YANMEGA",[POISON TAIL MOVE] [SILVER WIND MOVE] 
13,05,30,URSULA,"Plusle and Minun, Spark! Let's go! "

13,05,36,URSULA,All right Plusle and Minun go! 
13,05,37,"PLUSLE, MINUN",[SPARK MOVE] 
13,05,38,MARIAN,And that's the power of Helping Hand! 
13,05,39,MARIAN,"That combination neutralized Seviper and Yanmega's att*ck, leaving them vulnerable! "
13,05,40,JESSIE,"All right Yanmega, release Seviper! "
13,05,41,YANMEGA,[EXERTION] 
13,05,42,SEVIPER,[EXERTION]

13,05,52,MARIAN,The Coordinator moving on to the next battle stage is Ursula! 
13,05,53,URSULA,"But of course! Right, Plusle and Minun? "
13,05,54,"PLUSLE, MINUN",[HAPPY] 
13,05,55,DAWN,Perfect sync! Ursula's not going to be easy to b*at! 
13,05,56,JESSIE,"Lost? Who, me? "
13,05,57,"SEVIPER, YANMEGA",[SHOCK] 
13,05,58,MEOWTH,This kind of outcome I don't need! 
13,05,59,JAMES,Especially in light of my certitude that Haze and Sonic Boom were to be the combination b*mb. 
13,05,60,WOBBUFFET,[SAD AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,05,61,ASH,Ursula sure is strong! Tough to b*at! 
13,05,62,BROCK,Yeah! Someone's going to have to figure out how to stop those combinations to have any chance of b*ating Plusle and Minun!

13,05,81,MARIAN,"Simply amazing! We're witnessing a powerful flame and ice combination! Ice Shard, fused with Flame Wheel! "
13,05,82,BROCK,Not exactly what Dawn and her Pokémon intended. Not at all! 
13,05,83,ASH,It worked out okay! She was in a tight spot and turned it around to her advantage! 
13,05,84,PIPLUP,[AGREE] 
13,05,85,MARIAN,That's it! Time! Who's on to the next battle stage? It's Dawn! 
13,05,86,DAWN,All right you two! Thank you! We did it!

13,05,92,ASH,"Dawn, what's the problem? That combination looks good enough if you ask me! "
13,05,93,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
13,05,94,DAWN,"But, that's not what Flame Ice is supposed to look like... "
13,05,95,BROCK,And there's no guarantee it's going to work correctly the next time! 
13,05,96,BROCK,"Dawn, why don't you put it away for now and work on a more reliable combination? "
13,05,97,"MAMOSWINE, CYNDAQUIL",[PROUD] 
13,05,98,"PLUSLE, MINUN",[PROUD]

13,05,103,URSULA,"Boring! I mean, facing you in the finals, what a yawn! "
13,05,104,URSULA,"You must know what I mean- don't you, Dee Dee? "
13,05,105,PIPLUP,[CONCERN] 
13,05,106,DAWN,That's Dawn! 
13,05,107,URSULA,"Whatever. But you, b*at Plusle and Minun? "
13,05,108,DAWN,"Of course, I can b*at them! "

13,05,128,DAWN,Go Cyndaquil! 
13,05,129,CYNDAQUIL,[FLAMETHROWER MOVE]

13,05,168,BROCK,"It's called Encore, and it could be bad news for Dawn. "

13,05,170,URSULA,"So shall we get started? Plusle and Minun, let's steal the show! "

13,05,179,DAWN,Why are they using Swift and Take Down again? 
13,05,180,URSULA,"Scary right? Because we used Encore, all your Pokémon can do is repeat their last moves, get it? "
13,05,181,URSULA,"As long as Encore is in play, why go to the trouble of calling any att*cks at all? "
13,05,182,DAWN,"So that means no matter what, we won't be able to do anything! "
13,05,183,URSULA,"Plusle and Minun, Helping Hand! "
13,05,184,"PLUSLE, MINUN",[HELPING HAND MOVE]

13,05,195,MARIAN,"And finishing with an endearing pose, Plusle and Minun use Charge Beam to execute a stunning att*ck! "
13,05,196,ASH,"So that means, Dawn and her Pokémon can't use any other moves! "
13,05,197,BROCK,"Right, and because they're stuck with a five-minute time limit, Encore's about as scary an att*ck as you can get! "
13,05,198,JESSIE,"All right, I'm officially impressed. "
13,05,199,JAMES,Plusle and Minun can trounce the Twerpette to their heart's content!

13,04,13,PIKACHU,[CONCERN] 
13,04,14,PIPLUP,[CONFUSED] 
13,04,15,URSULA,You guys? 
13,04,16,"ASH, BROCK, PIKACHU",[SHOCK] 
13,04,17,DAWN,It's Ursula! 
13,04,18,URSULA,It's Dawn! 
13,04,19,DAWN,Hey! Long time no see! 
13,04,20,URSULA,"So you're actually competing in the Daybreak Contest, too? How many ribbons do you have? "
13,04,21,DAWN,"Uh, four of them! "
13,04,22,URSULA,Isn't that a coincidence! I have four as well! I wonder who will get their fifth ribbon first? 
13,04,23,DAWN,"Duh! For your information, we've been practicing hard for tomorrow, see? "
13,04,24,"PIPLUP, CYNDAQUIL",[PROUDLY] 
13,04,25,MAMOSWINE,[DETERMINED] 
13,04,26,URSULA,"Yeah, yeah, you've been practicing hard, fine! But your best won't be nearly enough to b*at us! So meet the ace Pokémon I raised just for our Double Performance! "
13,04,27,URSULA,I now present you with Plusle and Minun! 
13,04,28,"PLUSLE, MINUN",[CHEERING] 
13,04,29,DAWN,"No, no, no! "
13,04,30,"PIPLUP, CYNDAQUIL, MAMOSWINE",[CONFUSED] 
13,04,31,ASH,What are you so afraid of? 
13,04,32,BROCK,Look at how cute Plusle and Minun are! 
13,04,33,ASH,"This can't be the first time you've seen them, right? "
13,04,34,POKEDEX,"Plusle. The Cheering Pokémon. Plusle loves to cheer for its fellow Pokémon, and it creates sparkling pom-poms by shorting out the electrical current released from its paws. "
13,04,35,POKEDEX,Minun. The Cheering Pokémon. Minun and Plusle's electrical current promotes blood circulation and energizes their target. 
13,04,36,DAWN,"No, this is serious! No! Anything but Plusle and Minun, please? "
13,04,37,URSULA,"Dawn, how rude can you get? If you keep this up, you'll hurt both of their feelings! "
13,04,38,"PLUSLE, MINUN",[OFFENDED] 
13,04,39,DAWN,Sorry. 
13,04,40,URSULA,"I know, as a special treat I'll give you a taste of Plusle and Minun's contest performance! Now, pay attention, and you're bound to feel major happiness and joy! "
13,04,41,"PLUSLE, MINUN",[EXCITED] 
13,04,42,URSULA,"All right, Plusle and Minun, jump! "
13,04,43,"PLUSLE, MINUN",[EXERTION] 
13,04,44,"PLUSLE, MINUN",[CHEERING] 
13,04,45,URSULA,"Wow, Dawn, you look hilarious! "
13,04,46,BROCK,"Hey, your hair's sparkling like a diamond! "
13,04,47,DAWN,D-diamond? 
13,04,48,ASH,Hey Dawn? 
13,04,49,PIPLUP,[CONCERN] 
13,04,50,URSULA,Oh my! 
13,04,51,MEOWTH,Hey remember that twirly-haired Twerpette? With a Gabite in the Chocovine Tournament? 
13,04,52,WOBBUFFET,[QUIET AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,04,53,JAMES,It seems the Twerpette rivalry lives! 
13,04,54,JESSILINA [JESSIE],"Well, while those babies are babbling I'm going to win the Contest! "
13,04,55,MEOWTH,I like it! You stay focused while those dopes flap their yaps! 
13,04,56,JESSIE,"And let us not forget, Carnivine has the ultimate Contest performance move on tap! "
13,04,57,MEOWTH,Hard work is worth it when it comes to trouncing Twerps! 
13,04,58,WOBBUFFET,[QUIET AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,04,59,JESSILINA [JESSIE],All right! The call has been sounded for Team Rocket to mount its most brilliant performance to date! 
13,04,60,"JAMES, MEOWTH","Yes, that's great! "
13,04,61,PIPLUP,[CONCERN] 
13,04,62,BROCK,"Dawn, are you all right? "
13,04,63,ASH,Brought you some hot milk! Here! 
13,04,64,DAWN,"Oh. Thank you, Ash "
13,04,65,DAWN,"Wow, that was really thoughtful of you! "
13,04,66,ASH,"Thanks, but it was Brock's idea... "
13,04,67,BROCK,I figured if you drank something warm it would calm you right down! 
13,04,68,PIPLUP,[CONCERN] 
13,04,69,DAWN,"I'm just fine, Piplup! Don't worry. "
13,04,70,ASH,"So, what happened to you before? "
13,04,71,BROCK,It was weird the way you reacted when you saw Plusle and Minun. You were freaked! 
13,04,72,DAWN,I know. 
13,04,73,BROCK,Something must've happened before... 
13,04,74,ASH,"Hey! I'll bet you, you tried to catch Plusle and Minun once but you couldn't, right? "
13,04,75,DAWN,Not right. You see... 
13,04,76,ASH,What's wrong? 
13,04,77,BROCK,If you don't want to talk about it that's fine. 
13,04,78,DAWN,I was going to tell you about it one day so why not now? 
13,04,79,DAWN,It happened when I was in kindergarten. 
13,04,80,DAWN,"Kenny, Leona, and I were given the job of Pokémon caretakers! "
13,04,81,ASH,Pokémon caretakers? 
13,04,82,DAWN,"Our class had a Plusle and Minun. So, as Pokémon caretakers, it was our job to give them their Pokémon food, make sure they always had fresh water, and clean their playpen every day! "
13,04,83,DAWN,But then. 
13,04,84,DAWN [KINDERGARTEN],"Plusle! Minun! Come back! Come on! You always let me hold you two! Slow down! Please? Plusle? Minun? Just a little hug, please? "
13,04,85,KENNY [KINDERGARTEN],"Hey, stop goofing off, Dawn! "
13,04,86,LEONA [KINDERGARTEN],"You're a Pokémon caretaker, too! "
13,04,87,DAWN [KINDERGARTEN],"Well, since you're busy giving them their Pokémon food I thought I'd hold Plusle and Minun and that'd help keep them out of your way! "
13,04,88,"PLUSLE, MINUN",[STRUGGLING] 
13,04,89,DAWN [KINDERGARTEN],"Okay, time to calm down you two! We can all play together later! "
13,04,90,KENNY [KINDERGARTEN],They don't look too happy. 
13,04,91,DAWN [KINDERGARTEN],"No need to worry! See, we're best buddies, right? "
13,04,92,"PLUSLE, MINUN",[STRUGGLING] 
13,04,93,LEONA [KINDERGARTEN],"Hey, Dawn. You okay? "
13,04,94,DAWN [KINDERGARTEN],"No need to worry, Leona. "
13,04,95,KENNY [KINDERGARTEN],Your hair's sparkling like a diamond! 
13,04,96,LEONA [KINDERGARTEN],Like dandruff! 
13,04,97,KENNY [KINDERGARTEN],'m calling you Diamond Dandruff! 
13,04,98,LEONA [KINDERGARTEN],"Yeah, good idea! "
13,04,99,KENNY [KINDERGARTEN],Or Dee Dee for short! Perfect! 
13,04,100,"PLUSLE, MINUN",[EATING] 
13,04,101,TEACHER,"So, Turtwig challenged that Buneary to a running race! ""Whoever reached the top of the hill wins!"" Buneary thought about this for a little while, and then said... "
13,04,102,KENNY [KINDERGARTEN],"Hey there, Diamond Dandruff Dee Dee!! "
13,04,103,BOY A [KINDERGARTEN],"Diamond Dandruff, huh? "
13,04,104,GIRL A [KINDERGARTEN],Dee Dee! 
13,04,105,DAWN [KINDERGARTEN],I don't want diamond dandruff! 
13,04,106,ASH,Whoa! 
13,04,107,ASH,"So, you got that nickname because of what happened with Plusle and Minun. Wow! "
13,04,108,PIPLUP,[UNDERSTANDING] 
13,04,109,DAWN,"Yeah. And because I loved them, I could never understand why they would want to do something so awful to me like that. "
13,04,110,"ASH, BROCK, PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[LAUGHING] 
13,04,111,DAWN,"All right you two, what's so funny? "
13,04,112,ASH,Sorry! But the thing that's funny is you! 
13,04,113,PIKACHU,[APOLOGETIC] 
13,04,114,PIPLUP,[AMUSED] 
13,04,115,DAWN,"Piplup, how dare you? "
13,04,116,BROCK,A Pokémon would never att*ck unless they were provoked first! 
13,04,117,ASH,The reason Plusle and Minum zapped you is because you were chasing after them in the first place! 
13,04,118,DAWN,"Wow, it was my fault! I never thought of that before... "
13,04,119,PIPLUP,[COMFORTING] 
13,04,120,ASH,"It's okay. Hey, no need to worry, Dawn! "
13,04,121,BROCK,"He's right! It was a big deal then, but if you take a good look at it now, it's no big deal at all, see? "
13,04,122,DAWN,I guess so. 
13,04,123,ASH,"So wipe out Ursula in tomorrow's contest, and you'll wipe out those bad memories, too! "
13,04,124,PIPLUP,[AGREE] 
13,04,125,BROCK,Ash is right! This is the perfect opportunity to free you from the past! 
13,04,126,DAWN,"Whoa, don't be too dramatic, Brock! "
13,04,127,DAWN,"But you know, you're both right! I'll do it, thanks! "
13,04,128,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
13,04,129,URSULA,"That story was sure cute. Thanks a lot, Dee Dee! "
13,04,130,MARIAN,"The cheers and excitement are mounting, which can mean only one thing: Get ready for the fabulous Daybreak Town Pokémon Contest! "
13,04,131,MARIAN,"The waiting is finally over, and you'll soon see that it was all worth it! "

13,04,142,MARIAN,"Please allow me to introduce myself as well. I'm your humble host, Marian! "
13,04,143,DAWN,"Piplup, it's time! "
13,04,144,PIPLUP,[DETERMINED] 
13,04,145,DAWN,"And remember, we've come a long way since we had our Double Performance back at Hearthome City, right? You know? "
13,04,146,PIPLUP,[AGREE] 
13,04,147,DAWN,"Since then, we won a few and lost a few, our skills are sharper and we've leveled up a ton! So let's go out and have fun! "
13,04,148,PIPLUP,[AGREE] 
13,04,149,DAWN,We're going to win this!

13,04,151,URSULA,Wow! 
13,04,152,URSULA,Thanks! You've been playing with my Plusle and Minun! That's so nice! 
13,04,153,URSULA,Miss Dee Dee! 
13,04,154,DAWN,"It's Dawn, not Dee Dee! Hey, how do you know that name? "
13,04,155,URSULA,Who knows? Aren't you going to sparkle your hair do? 
13,04,156,DAWN,Of course not! 
13,04,157,JESSILINA [JESSIE],"You can't argue too much, I say! Because I'll swoop in and take that ribbon away! "
13,04,158,MARIAN,"So now Ladies and Gentlemen, let's begin with round one the Performance Stage! "
13,04,159,MARIAN,And here is our first entrant! 
13,04,160,JESSILINA [JESSIE],Hi there! It's Jessilina! 
13,04,161,MEOWTH,Those two are in synch.

13,04,163,WOBBUFFET,[AGREE] 
13,04,164,JESSIE,"Let's get this party started! Carnivine, rocket start! "
13,04,165,CARNIVINE,[APPEARING] 
13,04,166,CARNIVINE,[EXERTION] 
13,04,167,MARIAN,"Excuse me. Are you aware this is a Double Performance? You do need two Pokémon, of course! "
13,04,168,JESSILINA [JESSIE],Patience! I'm a step ahead of you! 
13,04,169,JAMES,That's it! She's on her game! 
13,04,170,MEOWTH,After this there won't be a dry seat in the house. 
13,04,171,ASH,Wonder what she's going to do! 
13,04,172,PIKACHU,[INTERESTED] 
13,04,173,BROCK,Maybe she won't be quite as offbeat this time! 
13,04,174,JESSILINA [JESSIE],"All right, Carnivine ready? "
13,04,175,CARNIVINE,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,04,176,CARNIVINE,[GRUNT]

13,04,178,SEVIPER,[APPEARING] 
13,04,179,MARIAN,Unbelievable! Seviper mysteriously appeared from Carnivine's mouth! Obviously Jessilina planted Seviper's Poké Ball there!

13,04,217,BUNEARY,[ICE BEAM MOVE] 
13,04,218,MARIAN,"Amazing! Buneary's Ice Beam has frozen Piplup's Bubble Beam, and the frozen bubbles are floating around the arena like balloons! "
13,04,219,ASH,It worked! How great is that? 
13,04,220,BROCK,"You're right, but it only gets harder from here... "
13,04,221,DAWN,"All right, Buneary, use Bounce! "

13,04,223,BUNEARY,[BOUNCE MOVE] 
13,04,224,DAWN,"Piplup, Buneary, great job! Keep it up! "
13,04,225,MARIAN,"Talk about fancy footwork! Not only is Buneary's Bounce and Piplup's Bubble Beam an unusual Combination Move, it's playing do-re-mi! "
13,04,226,URSULA,Not bad! 
13,04,227,JESSILINA [JESSIE],"Ha! Compared to my applause, hers doesn't even rate a zero! "

13,04,235,DAWN,You two were awesome! I've never seen amazing teamwork like you just showed! 
13,04,236,ASH,"Great job, Dawn! "
13,04,237,PIKACHU,[HAPPY] 
13,04,238,BROCK,That performance should give Dawn's confidence a boost! MR. 
13,04,239,CONTESTA,I simply couldn't take my eyes off of Piplup and Buneary's performance! What a Tag Team! MR. 
13,04,240,SUKIZO,Piplup and Buneary... both remarkable! 
13,04,241,NURSE JOY,And who would have expected them to play a tune as well? That was just so much fun! 
13,04,242,MARIAN,"Let's keep moving with more fun! So, next entrant you're on! "
13,04,243,URSULA,And here comes today's main attraction! 
13,04,244,URSULA,"Okay, Gabite! Now, let's go! "
13,04,245,GABITE,[READY] 
13,04,246,URSULA,"And Jigglypuff, you too! "
13,04,247,JIGGLYPUFF,[APPEARING] 
13,04,248,JIGGLYPUFF,[EXERTION] 
13,04,249,GABITE,[EXERTION] 
13,04,250,MARIAN,Gabite's speed and Jigglypuff's round body makes for quite a team! We should be seeing quite a performance! 
13,04,251,JIGGLYPUFF,[POSING] 
13,04,252,GABITE,[POSING] 
13,04,253,DAWN,A Jigglypuff. 
13,04,254,POKEDEX,"Jigglypuff. The Balloon Pokémon. When Jigglypuff's big eyes begin to quiver, everyone becomes sleepy as it sings a lullaby. "
13,04,255,JESSILINA [JESSIE],I thought the Twerps were an odd matchup... 
13,04,256,URSULA,"Jigglypuff, use Rollout, go! "
13,04,257,JIGGLYPUFF,[EXERTION] 
13,04,258,JIGGLYPUFF,[ROLLOUT MOVE] 
13,04,259,GABITE,[EXERTION] 
13,04,260,MARIAN,And Gabite gracefully directs Jigglypuff's Rollout using its shoulders! 
13,04,261,URSULA,"All right Gabite, Iron Tail! "
13,04,262,GABITE,[IRON TAIL MOVE] 
13,04,263,URSULA,Now Gabite time to use Stone Edge! 
13,04,264,GABITE,[EXERTION] 
13,04,265,GABITE,[STONE EDGE MOVE] 
13,04,266,URSULA,"Jigglypuff, use Hyper Voice! "
13,04,267,JIGGLYPUFF,[HYPER VOICE MOVE] 
13,04,268,MARIAN,"A bold performance, reminiscent of a battle round, and yet so beautiful! "
13,04,269,ASH,That's a lot of power going on! 
13,04,270,BROCK,"Yeah, Ursula's really trained those two quite well! "
13,04,271,PIKACHU,[IMPRESSED] 
13,04,272,DAWN,Awesome! That girl's definitely no slouch! 
13,04,273,PIPLUP,[AGREE] 
13,04,274,URSULA,"Jigglypuff, use Gyro Ball! "
13,04,275,JIGGLYPUFF,[GYRO BALL MOVE] 
13,04,276,URSULA,"Gabite, use Sand Tomb! "
13,04,277,GABITE,[SAND TOMB MOVE] 
13,04,278,MARIAN,Unbelievable! The clash between Gyro Ball and Sand Tomb is creating a brilliant glow! 
13,04,279,DAWN,Oh wow! 
13,04,280,URSULA,"Time to finish this up! Gabite, Dragon Claw! "
13,04,281,GABITE,[EXERTION] 
13,04,282,GABITE,[DRAGON CLAW MOVE] 
13,04,283,MARIAN,Oh my! Gabite's caught Jigglypuff gently on top of its Dragon Claw! 
13,04,284,JIGGLYPUFF,[POSING] 
13,04,285,GABITE,[POSING] 
13,04,286,MARIAN,And their performance comes full circle with the same pose they started with! 
13,04,287,URSULA,"Gabite and Jigglypuff, you were great! MR. "
13,04,288,CONTESTA,Gabite and Jigglypuff's performance was perfectly in sync! It was truly brilliant! MR. 
13,04,289,SUKIZO,"And not to mention, remarkable too! "
13,04,290,NURSE JOY,I'm so in awe of the way their combination moves were able to demonstrate so much of their talent and poise! 
13,04,291,MARIAN,And that brings us to the end of round one! Our next task is to find out who moves on to round two! 
13,04,292,MARIAN,"So, please be patient while the results are tabulated! "
13,04,293,ASH,"Wow, Dawn, you were great out there! "
13,04,294,DAWN,Hi guys! Thanks for the kind words! 
13,04,295,PIKACHU,[EXERTION] / [EXCITED]

13,04,297,PIKACHU,[EMBARESSED] 
13,04,298,BROCK,"Of course Piplup, and Buneary were great too! "
13,04,299,PIPLUP,[PROUD] 
13,04,300,"PIKACHU, PIPLUP, BUNEARY",[HAPPY] 
13,04,301,DAWN,I feel a lot more confident about doing a Double Performance now! And I'm going to win my fifth ribbon for sure! 
13,04,302,ASH,Well we know you're going to win it too! 
13,04,303,URSULA,"My, my, what a lovely friendship! "
13,04,304,DAWN,Ursula! 
13,04,305,URSULA,Obviously I'm moving on to round two but I did think your performance was at least energetic! 
13,04,306,JESSILINA [JESSIE],Drama queens! Like two Twerpettes in a pod! 
13,04,307,MARIAN,Our long wait is finally over! It's time to find out who's going on to round two! 
13,04,308,MARIAN,Our judges have decided that the eight talented Coordinators who will be competing in round two are... 
13,04,309,MARIAN,Up on our screen! 
13,04,310,JESSILINA [JESSIE],Twerpettes? Wonders never cease... 
13,04,311,ASH,You did it Dawn! It's onto round two! 
13,04,312,DAWN,And I have Piplup and Buneary to thank! 
13,04,313,"PIPLUP, BUNEARY",[HAPPY] 
13,04,314,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
13,04,315,BROCK,"Dawn, make sure you don't let your guard down during the Contest Battle! "
13,04,316,DAWN,Right! 
13,04,317,URSULA,"Yup, you listen to your friend. Don't forget I'll be using both Plusle and Minun, and I can't wait to battle you! "
13,04,318,DAWN,You'll lose too! Remember my fifth Ribbon's on the line! 
13,04,319,URSULA,You remember that makes two of us! So! Just make sure you don't lose until you battle with me. 
13,04,320,"PLUSLE, MINUN",[EXERTION] 
13,04,321,DAWN,No! 
13,04,322,NARRATOR,"With a confident rival waiting to challenge her, Dawn has conquered Round One of Daybreak Town's Pokémon Contest! Now, what excitement awaits us in Round Two, and who will win the Daybreak Ribbon? Stay tuned for answers"
13,03,0,NARRATOR,"With the opportunity for Dawn to win her all-important fifth contest ribbon luring them on, we once again join our heroes on their trip to Daybreak Town! "
13,03,1,"DAWN, ASH, BROCK, PIPLUP, PIKACHU",[SURPRISED] 
13,03,2,ASH,"Whoa, what's that? "
13,03,3,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
13,03,4,BROCK,Looks like a trampoline! 
13,03,5,PIPLUP,[HAPPY] 
13,03,6,"PIPLUP, PIKACHU",[PLAYFUL] 
13,03,7,DAWN,But what in the world is a trampoline doing out here in the forest? 
13,03,8,SNORLAX,[PLAYFUL] 
13,03,9,"PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[SCARED] 
13,03,10,ASH,"Hold on, Pikachu, I'll catch you! "
13,03,11,PIKACHU,[RELIEVED] 
13,03,12,DAWN,"Here, Piplup!  "
13,03,13,PIPLUP,[RELIEVED] 
13,03,14,SNORLAX,[PLAYFUL] 
13,03,15,DAWN,Snorlax? 
13,03,16,POKEDEX,"Snorlax. The Sleeping Pokémon. Snorlax becomes much too lazy to lift even a finger when it has a full belly, which then makes it safe to bounce upon. "
13,03,17,DAWN,It sure can move for being so big! 
13,03,18,BROCK,Yeah! I'll bet Snorlax works out a lot! 
13,03,19,DANIEL,Excellent! You've improved your response time by a whole fifteen percent! 
13,03,20,ASH,"Uh, who are you? "
13,03,21,DANIEL,"Who am I? My name's Daniel, scientist extraordinaire and genius! "
13,03,22,DAWN,"Humble, too. "
13,03,23,DANIEL,And you are? 
13,03,24,ASH,Hi! I'm Ash! 
13,03,25,DAWN,I'm Dawn! 
13,03,26,BROCK,And my name's Brock! Is that your Snorlax? You raised it really well! 
13,03,27,DANIEL,"Well, of course! What did you expect? My Pokémon are raised using only the choicest of scientific training methods! "
13,03,28,"ASH, DAWN, BROCK",Scientific training? It's about you It's about me It's about hope It's about dreams It's about friends that work together To claim their destiny It's about reaching for the skies Pokemon! Given the courage And willing to try It's about never giving up So hold your head up And we will carry on... Sinnoh league victors Pokemon! 
13,03,29,DANIEL,You're now standing in my training facility! 
13,03,30,ASH,Whoa. 
13,03,31,DANIEL,And this is where the scientific training I alluded to takes place! 
13,03,32,DANIEL,To improve the skillfulness of my Pokémon! 
13,03,33,"DAWN, ASH, BROCK, PIPLUP, PIKACHU",[CONFUSED] 
13,03,34,ASH,Blindfold? 
13,03,35,SNORLAX,[EXERTION] 
13,03,36,DAWN,Wonder what he's up to now? 
13,03,37,DANIEL,This exercise increases the level of synchronization between Pokémon and Trainer! 
13,03,38,SNORLAX,[EXERTION] 
13,03,39,"DAWN, ASH, BROCK, PIPLUP, PIKACHU",[SURPRISED] 
13,03,40,"DANIEL, SNORLAX",[EXERTION] 
13,03,41,"DAWN, ASH, BROCK, PIPLUP, PIKACHU",[SHOCKED] 
13,03,42,"DANIEL, SNORLAX",[EXERTION] 
13,03,43,ASH,Wow! It's jumping even with a blindfold on! 
13,03,44,PIKACHU,[AMAZED] 
13,03,45,DANIEL,Good! Our level of synchronization has increased by more than ten percent! 
13,03,46,BROCK,I see! This really is scientific! 
13,03,47,ASH,"That's cool, but Pikachu and I don't need any of that fancy technology to know our hearts are connected! Right, buddy? "
13,03,48,PIKACHU,[AGREEMENT] 
13,03,49,DANIEL,"Well, that's way too abstract for me! Snorlax and I are connected by the power of provable science! "
13,03,50,ASH,So why don't we have a battle to see whose hearts are more connected? Let's do it right now! - 
13,03,51,DANIEL,A battle? - 
13,03,52,ASH,What's so funny? 
13,03,53,DANIEL,It is impossible to compare something like the level of synchronization by having a battle! 
13,03,54,ASH,Oh yeah? 
13,03,55,DANIEL,"But I do know the perfect competition. One that tests synchronicity, but also speed, jumping ability, and skill, stamina, and power! And it tests for every one of them at the very same time! "
13,03,56,"DAWN, ASH, BROCK, PIPLUP, PIKACHU",[SURPRISED] 
13,03,57,DANIEL,Behold! Pokéathlon! 
13,03,58,DAWN,Pokéathlon? Never heard of it! 
13,03,59,DANIEL,Then prepare to be educated! 
13,03,60,DANIEL,"The very first Pokéathlon was held in Johto, and is comprised of a total of ten events, three events of which are randomly chosen every time the Pokéathlon is held. The rules explicitly state that participating Trainers are only allowed to pick one Pokémon for each event! "
13,03,61,DAWN,Nice! 
13,03,62,DANIEL,And it just so happens that a Pokéathlon is being held today right here in Camellia Town! 
13,03,63,BROCK,"Of course! This must be the first Pokéathlon ever to be held in Sinnoh, right? "
13,03,64,DANIEL,You mean you've heard of the Pokéathlon before? 
13,03,65,ASH,"Sure! See, we spent lots of time traveling through Johto. "
13,03,66,DAWN,"So the first event is a Disc Catch, followed by a halftime show instead of a normal second event, and then finishing up with a Hurdle Dash. "
13,03,67,ASH,"Wow, a Hurdle Dash? Man! That event sounds cool! "
13,03,68,DAWN,The whole day sounds cool! 
13,03,69,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
13,03,70,BROCK,"The event today is a qualifying match, and the winner gets to enter the regional competition! "
13,03,71,ASH,"That settles that! Guess you know what this means, right, Pikachu? "
13,03,72,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
13,03,73,DANIEL,Look! No non-scientist could ever defeat me in a million years! I know just who's going to win! 
13,03,74,BROCK,Looks like registration's over there! 
13,03,75,ASH,"What about you, Dawn? "
13,03,76,DAWN,"Our contest is coming up, so I think I'll just sit this one out! "
13,03,77,ASH,Got it! 
13,03,78,DANIEL,"I'm so sure we're going to lose to a Pokémon who's been trained ""by feeling""! Right, Snorlax? "
13,03,79,SNORLAX,[TIRED] 
13,03,80,ASH,It looks to me like your Snorlax is feeling a little worn out. 
13,03,81,DANIEL,What? That's not even possible! 
13,03,82,ASH,"Come on, Daniel. You're a Trainer, too, so I know you should be able to tell! It looks to me like Snorlax might be a little worn out from training so hard. "
13,03,83,SNORLAX,[TIRED] 
13,03,84,"TRAINERS, GRUMPIG",[HAPPY] 
13,03,85,DANIEL,I can't believe it! 
13,03,86,DANIEL,Snorlax's energy is way below normal! 
13,03,87,DANIEL,And its exhaustion composite has increased by percent as well! Hey! How did that kid know Snorlax was tired without using a computer or sensors to monitor it? 
13,03,88,JAMES,"Begging your pardon, kind sir! "
13,03,89,MEOWTH,I'd say you've got quite the tuckered Pokémon on your hands! 
13,03,90,JAMES,I heartily recommend you bring it to our Pokémon spa salon for a lovely and invigorating scientific massage! 
13,03,91,DANIEL,A scientific...massage? 
13,03,92,JAMES,Excellent auditory assimilation! It's the most researched massage one can get! 
13,03,93,MEOWTH,We're going to woo you with science! 
13,03,94,JAMES,"A customer, Massage Master! "
13,03,95,JESSIE,"When it comes to massage art, we're all thumbs! "
13,03,96,DANIEL,"My Snorlax is going to compete in the third-round hurdle race today! So, you think you can have it up to speed by that time? "
13,03,97,JESSIE,Zoom zoom! 
13,03,98,JESSIE,Our Massage Masterdigit Mark Two employs the scientific method to examine and best treat Pokémon pooped-outness! 
13,03,99,SNORLAX,[RELAXED] 
13,03,100,MEOWTH,Those flying fingers will make your Snorlax a record-breaker! 
13,03,101,DANIEL,Oh really? Then let's go! 
13,03,102,JAMES,Ho ho! We'll give a scientific ring when Snorlax is chock full of zing! 
13,03,103,"JAMES, MEOWTH",You're both in good hands with our hands! 
13,03,104,JESSIE,It's this kind of scientific Pokémon roundup that's sure to round us up a big promotion from the Boss! 
13,03,105,"JAMES, MEOWTH",Then we'll cut our loss! 
13,03,106,MEOWTH,What do you know! Pikachu and its Twerp! 
13,03,107,JAMES,"I'd hazard that they're both competing, too. "
13,03,108,MEOWTH,I've got an idea! Dig it! 
13,03,109,MEOWTH,Nice Pikachu! 
13,03,110,"ASH, PIKACHU",[SURPRISED] 
13,03,111,JAMES,Whee! And raised with tons of TLC. 
13,03,112,ASH,"Hey, thanks, you guys! "
13,03,113,JAMES,"Say, though Pikachu seems healthy, excessive practice could cause a train drain! "
13,03,114,MEOWTH,But a massage might be just the ticket to feeling tippy-tops! And we're offering grand-opening price breaks! 
13,03,115,JAMES,You'll both be in the pink for not much green! 
13,03,116,ASH,"Whoa! You really think? It sounds great! Pikachu, what do you say? "
13,03,117,PIKACHU,[PAINED] / [SHEEPISH] 
13,03,118,ASH,"See, the thing is we're going to compete in the Hurdle Dash together this afternoon, so will you be finished in time? "
13,03,119,MEOWTH,Piece of cake! There's other clients hurdling along with you! 
13,03,120,JAMES,You'll be all patched up and ready to heave-ho before the show! 
13,03,121,PIKACHU,[SURPRISED] 
13,03,122,EMCEE,It's time for the first fabulous Camellia Pokéathlon to get under way! 
13,03,123,EMCEE,Now for our first event it's the Disc Catch! 
13,03,124,EMCEE,"At this time, I will ask all competitors to gather in the middle of the field so we can begin! "
13,03,125,DAWN,"Hey, Brock? I'm not exactly sure what a Disc Catch is, are you? "
13,03,126,BROCK,"It's where a Trainer uses a seesaw to launch his Pokémon into the air, where it then catches incoming discs! "
13,03,127,BROCK,"It tests a Pokémon's reflexes in its jumping ability, not to mention the power of the relationship with its Trainer. "
13,03,128,DANIEL,"We both know my Hitmonlee has the advantage! If it's high jumping, we're talking number one! "
13,03,129,ASH,"To tell you the truth, I think my Monferno's got you b*at, hands down! "
13,03,130,MONFERNO,[CHEERING] 
13,03,131,DANIEL,"You can try all you want, but you can't defeat real science! "
13,03,132,ASH,You've never been in a battle until you've battled with me! 
13,03,133,DANIEL,"Oh, that's real scientific! "
13,03,134,COUNTDOWN,"Three, two, one! "
13,03,135,ASH,All right! 
13,03,136,DANIEL,Here we go! 
13,03,137,MEDICHAM,[FOCUSED]

13,03,146,"DAWN,BROCK",Wow! Yeah! 
13,03,147,EMCEE,"And the big winner of the Disc Catch is... Say! It's a tie! It's a tie between Ash and Daniel, who lead the Pokéathlon with  points each! "
13,03,148,ASH,Monferno! You were great! 
13,03,149,MONFERNO,[PLEASED] 
13,03,150,DANIEL,Too impressive! 
13,03,151,EMCEE,Ladies and gentlemen! Replacing our second event! 
13,03,152,EMCEE,"For your enjoyment, this very special performance exhibition! So give it up for last year's champion, Spoink! "
13,03,153,COUNTDOWN,"Ready, set, go! "
13,03,154,SPOINK,[EXERTION] 
13,03,155,DAWN,Something tells me that Spoink doesn't need that trampoline. 
13,03,156,BROCK,Hold on! 
13,03,157,BROCK,I don't see Ash down there! 
13,03,158,DAWN,But the Hurdle Dash is going to get started now! 
13,03,159,ASH,"I'd better move it and get Pikachu back to the arena, fast! "
13,03,160,DANIEL,Why are you here? 
13,03,161,ASH,"My Pikachu is getting a massage in there, get it? "
13,03,162,DANIEL,"That's strange. Snorlax, too! "
13,03,163,ASH,That is weird. 
13,03,164,DANIEL,Hey! What is that thing? 
13,03,165,ASH,I know! 
13,03,166,ASH,It's Team Rocket! 
13,03,167,PIKACHU,[STRUGGLING] 
13,03,168,ASH,Pikachu! 
13,03,169,DANIEL,Snorlax! 
13,03,170,SNORLAX,[SURPRISED] 
13,03,171,ASH,All right! Hold it! 
13,03,172,DANIEL,What in the world? 
13,03,173,JESSIE,"Out of this world, that's how we roll! "
13,03,174,JAMES,Being grounded can take its toll! 
13,03,175,JESSIE,On the wind! 
13,03,176,JAMES,Past the stars! 
13,03,177,MEOWTH,Heart and soul! 
13,03,178,JESSIE,Bringing chaos at a breakneck pace! 
13,03,179,JAMES,"Dashing all hope, putting fear in its place! "
13,03,180,JESSIE,Magic fingers bring calming and joy. 
13,03,181,JAMES,But not to a certain Twerpish boy. - 
13,03,182,JESSIE,Jessie! - 
13,03,183,JAMES,And James! 
13,03,184,MEOWTH,Meowth's the name! 
13,03,185,JESSIE,You do-gooders sure are uptight! 
13,03,186,JAMES,We're Team Rocket! 
13,03,187,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",Want to fight?

13,03,189,MIME JR.,[MIMICKING] 
13,03,190,DANIEL,Team Rocket? 
13,03,191,ASH,"Yeah, they're a bunch of crooks that try to steal other people's Pokémon! "
13,03,192,MEOWTH,"We succeed, too! "
13,03,193,JAMES,I didn't know we had brakes! 
13,03,194,JESSIE,Balloons don't have brakes! 
13,03,195,MEOWTH,Maybe there's a recall! 
13,03,196,MEOWTH,Snorlax is packing too many pounds! 
13,03,197,JESSIE,This wouldn't have been necessary if you'd packed it in its Poké Ball! 
13,03,198,JAMES,Hindsight is overrated as a useful tool. 
13,03,199,JESSIE,"Well, I'm no fool! Yanmega, help us cut and run! "
13,03,200,YANMEGA,[APPEARING] 
13,03,201,JESSIE,"With Pikachu in our possession, Snorlax is nothing but ballast! So cut loose that loser with Steel Wing! "
13,03,202,YANMEGA,[STEEL WING att*ck] 
13,03,203,JESSIE,Excellent! Return! 
13,03,204,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH","And so, off we go! Into a sky of blue, sporting Pikachu! "
13,03,205,DANIEL,Snorlax! Are you right! 
13,03,206,SNORLAX,[HAPPY] 
13,03,207,ASH,"All right, Staraptor, I choose you! "
13,03,208,STARAPTOR,[APPEARING] 
13,03,209,ASH,"Go and save Pikachu, okay? "
13,03,210,STARAPTOR,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,03,211,JESSIE,Heads up! It appears that the Twerp is relying on air support! 
13,03,212,STARAPTOR,[EXERTION] 
13,03,213,MEOWTH,Watch the hands! 
13,03,214,MEOWTH,"When it comes to power punching, these paws will deck a Pokémon in a Sinnoh minute! "
13,03,215,STARAPTOR,[SHOCKED] 
13,03,216,MEOWTH,"And a left, and a right, and a fight, fight, fight! "
13,03,217,STARAPTOR,[IMPACT] 
13,03,218,MEOWTH,Left-right-left-right-left! 
13,03,219,MEOWTH,One-two-one-two-one!

13,03,221,STARAPTOR,[STUNNED] 
13,03,222,ASH,"Staraptor, return! "
13,03,223,JESSIE,"Wow, Meowth, you're a champ! "
13,03,224,MEOWTH,No rope-a-doping with our heavyweight! 
13,03,225,JAMES,What fists! It's all in the robotic wrists! 
13,03,226,JAMES,Hey! Round over! 
13,03,227,DANIEL,Nice bounce! Again! 
13,03,228,SNORLAX,[EXERTION] 
13,03,229,JESSIE,That couldn't be! 
13,03,230,SNORLAX,[GREETING] 
13,03,231,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",It is! 
13,03,232,SNORLAX,[EXERTION] 
13,03,233,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",Rematch! 
13,03,234,MEOWTH,Round two!

13,03,236,PIKACHU,[SCARED] 
13,03,237,ASH,Pikachu! 
13,03,238,ASH,I won't get to where Pikachu's going to land on time! 
13,03,239,SNORLAX,[EXERTION] 
13,03,240,PIKACHU,[SCARED] 
13,03,241,PIKACHU,[GRATEFUL] 
13,03,242,SNORLAX,[PLEASED] 
13,03,243,JAMES,No! Pikachu's been saved by a stomach! 
13,03,244,JESSIE,I thought you'd been saved by half a brain! 
13,03,245,MEOWTH,Cut it out! This is a reality show! 
13,03,246,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",We're blasting off again! 
13,03,247,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,03,248,DANIEL,"Snorlax, you were amazing! "
13,03,249,ASH,Daniel! Thanks a lot! You saved Pikachu from Team Rocket! 
13,03,250,PIKACHU,[GRATEFUL] 
13,03,251,DANIEL,"Well, if I'm going to b*at you fair and square, I've got to use science all the way down the line! "
13,03,252,EMCEE,"Participants will please report to the track immediately, as our third event, the Hurdle Dash, is about to begin! "
13,03,253,DANIEL,"Uh-oh! We'd better get moving, quick! "
13,03,254,ASH,Right! 
13,03,255,EMCEE,"Attention, competitors! The Hurdle Dash will begin in exactly one minute! "
13,03,256,BROCK,"Wow, I wonder where Ash and Daniel could be? "
13,03,257,DAWN,"Yeah, and after they both did so well by ending up tying for the first round! "
13,03,258,ASH,Hey! Wait for us! 
13,03,259,BROCK,That sounded like Ash! 
13,03,260,DAWN,Look! Over there! 
13,03,261,ASH,"Sorry! See, we got hung up! "
13,03,262,DANIEL,But we're all ready to go now! - 
13,03,263,ATTENDANT,Then hurry! - 
13,03,264,DANIEL,Right! 
13,03,265,ASH,What's that? 
13,03,266,DANIEL,It syncs you up with your Pokémon! 
13,03,267,DANIEL,It uses the same principles as the device I use in my training! 
13,03,268,EMCEE,"Now that each Trainer has received their devices, I will now explain how they're used! "
13,03,269,EMCEE,You will notice that each of your Pokémon has been equipped with a video camera. 
13,03,270,EMCEE,The image from that camera will be visible to the Trainer using the goggles they've just been given! 
13,03,271,EMCEE,"As each Pokémon runs, hurdles will suddenly appear on the track! However, these hurdles will be visible to the Trainers before their Pokémon. At the appropriate time, the Trainers will jump, which then transmits a signal to their Pokémon, signaling them to jump! Success in the third-round Hurdle Dash will depend on the perfect timing and execution of those jumps! "
13,03,272,DAWN,Here we go! 
13,03,273,BROCK,Yeah! I think we both know who's going to win this! 
13,03,274,DANIEL,"Okay, let's do this fair and square! "
13,03,275,ASH,You've got it! 
13,03,276,EMCEE,"Now, everybody ready to go? All right, countdown! "
13,03,277,COUNTDOWN,"Three, two, one! "

13,03,290,BROCK,Pikachu and Snorlax are neck and neck! 
13,03,291,DAWN,"Run, Pikachu! Go, Ash, do it! "
13,03,292,PIPLUP,[CHEERING] 
13,03,293,"PIKACHU, SNORLAX",[EXERTION] 
13,03,294,ASH,"Come on, Pikachu! "
13,03,295,PIKACHU,[EXERTION]

13,03,299,BROCK,"Whoa! All right, who won? "
13,03,300,EMCEE,Upon careful review. 
13,03,301,EMCEE,Our judges have determined that Snorlax's belly edged in first! And that makes the winners of the Camellia Pokéathlon Daniel and Snorlax! 
13,03,302,"DANIEL, SNORLAX",[DELIGHTED] 
13,03,303,ASH,"Congratulations, Daniel! "
13,03,304,DANIEL,"Hey, Ash! "
13,03,305,ASH,"That was awesome! From now on, I'm going to have to pay lots more attention to your training style! "
13,03,306,DANIEL,"Well, actually...to be totally honest, I realize I shouldn't rely that much on science! I've got to learn how to understand my Pokémon's feelings as well! "
13,03,307,ASH,"Yeah! And you'll be great at it, too! "
13,03,308,PIKACHU,[HAPPY] 
13,03,309,ASH,Good luck in the Johto Pokéathlon! I'm rooting for you! 
13,03,310,DANIEL,"Thanks, and I'll be rooting for you in the Sinnoh League! "
13,03,311,DAWN,"You know, I think those two are buddies now! "
13,03,312,BROCK,"Yeah! Their training styles may be different, but their love of Pokémon goes beyond those differences! Your contest is coming soon! "
13,03,313,DAWN,"And I can hardly wait! What do you say, Piplup? "
13,03,314,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
13,03,315,NARRATOR,"Although unsuccessful at winning the Pokéathlon, Ash was a huge success at making a new friend! And now it's on to Daybreak Town, where Dawn's fifth contest ribbon hangs in the balance. You don't want to miss it, so stay tuned"
13,02,0,NARRATOR,"A frolicking forest stream provides our heroes with a little rest and relaxation, en route to Daybreak Town and Dawn's next Pokémon Contest! "
13,02,1,PIPLUP,[HAPPY] 
13,02,2,ASH,"All right, Gible! While we practice Draco Meteor, you need to concentrate and focus your Dragon-type Pokémon power! "
13,02,3,GIBLE,[FOCUSED] 
13,02,4,ASH,"Now concentrate that power in your center, and then fire! "
13,02,5,GIBLE,[DRACO METEOR MOVE] 
13,02,6,ASH,Looking good!  
13,02,7,GIBLE,[WORRIED] 
13,02,8,PIPLUP,[PANICKED] 
13,02,9,DAWN,"Piplup, no! "
13,02,10,PIKACHU,[CONCERNED] 
13,02,11,DAWN,"Oh, Piplup, are you okay? "
13,02,12,PIPLUP,[STUNNED] 
13,02,13,BROCK,"You know, Piplup's always in the wrong place at the wrong time. "
13,02,14,DAWN,"Ash, be careful, please? "
13,02,15,ASH,"Sorry about that! Gible, get the next one right, okay? "
13,02,16,GIBLE,[AGGRESSIVE] 
13,02,17,ASH,Gible! 
13,02,18,GIBLE,[SHOCKED] 
13,02,19,ASH,Gible! 
13,02,20,GIBLE,[STRUGGLING] 
13,02,21,DAWN,Oh no! 
13,02,22,PIKACHU,[CONCERNED] 
13,02,23,ASH,"Okay, Buizel, quick! I choose you! "
13,02,24,BUIZEL,[APPEARING]

13,02,31,ASH,"Gible, return, now! "
13,02,32,GIBLE,[COMPLAINING] MR. 
13,02,33,MIME,[EXERTION] 
13,02,34,ASH,"What's that? CLAYTON, MR. "
13,02,35,MIME,[DETERMINED] It's about you It's about me It's about hope It's about dreams It's about friends that work together To claim their destiny It's about reaching for the skies Pokemon! Given the courage And willing to try It's about never giving up So hold your head up And we will carry on... Sinnoh league victors Pokemon! 
13,02,36,ASH,Whoa. Check them out. 
13,02,37,DAWN,Who's that Pokémon? 
13,02,38,POKEDEX,"Mr. Mime. The Barrier Pokémon. By rapidly moving its fingers, Mr. Mime can stop air molecules to create an invisible wall. "
13,02,39,CLAYTON,"I'm a Trainer named Clayton! I'm also the man with the sublime fists! They call me ""Clayton Sub-Fists!"" "
13,02,40,BROCK,He's kidding! 
13,02,41,ASH,Clayton Sub-Fists? 
13,02,42,CLAYTON,And this is my partner! In short? My-par! Mr. Mime! MR. 
13,02,43,MIME,[PROUD] 
13,02,44,DAWN,That's so weird. 
13,02,45,PIPLUP,[CONFUSED] 
13,02,46,PIKACHU,[CONFUSED] 
13,02,47,BUIZEL,[CONFUSED] 
13,02,48,CLAYTON,"Now for you! You all look like Pokémon Trainers! Poké-ners, in short! "
13,02,49,DAWN,"Poké-ners, right. "
13,02,50,BROCK,"Wow, I'd love to know where those abbreviations come from, you know? "
13,02,51,CLAYTON,All right! Tell me your names! 
13,02,52,ASH,"My name's Ash, and these are my Pokémon Pikachu and Buizel! "
13,02,53,PIKACHU,[GREETING] 
13,02,54,BUIZEL,[GREETING] 
13,02,55,DAWN,And my name's Dawn! I'd like you to meet my partner Piplup! 
13,02,56,PIPLUP,[GREETING] 
13,02,57,BROCK,"Hello, I'm Brock! And I'm a Pokémon Breeder! "
13,02,58,CLAYTON,"Got it! Ash-Pika, Ash-Bui, Dawn-Pip, Bro-Bree! "
13,02,59,CLAYTON,Got it! Nice to meet you all! 
13,02,60,BROCK,"Uh, likewise! "
13,02,61,DAWN,Nice to meet you! 
13,02,62,CLAYTON,"You see, I'm a Pokémon Martial Artist! Mr. Mime and I have been training together for many years, and this is my personal training field! "
13,02,63,ASH,A Trainer and a martial artist! 
13,02,64,PIKACHU,[IMPRESSED] 
13,02,65,CLAYTON,"That's right! A Pokémon battle is where skills and wills collide! For years, I traveled the world honing my Pokémon Martial Arts skills. But after arriving here, I chose to remain, because this is the perfect place for me to train and attain the highest of skill levels! So I've been training right here ever since! "
13,02,66,DAWN,I'm impressed! 
13,02,67,BROCK,I'm thinking. 
13,02,68,CLAYTON,"By the way, you! Buizel! "
13,02,69,BUIZEL,[SURPRISED] 
13,02,70,CLAYTON,That heroic rescue of yours was inspiring! 
13,02,71,BROCK,Heroic rescue? That's over the top... 
13,02,72,CLAYTON,You've got potential! And so! MR. 
13,02,73,MIME,[EXERTION] 
13,02,74,CLAYTON,"I want to see just how powerful you are, so will you battle against my Mr. Mime? "
13,02,75,BUIZEL,[DETERMINED] 
13,02,76,ASH,"Yeah! We'll show you, all right! "
13,02,77,BUIZEL,[EXCITED] 
13,02,78,CLAYTON,Over here! [PLEASED] 
13,02,79,ASH,"Come on, Buizel, let's go! "
13,02,80,BUIZEL,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,02,81,JESSIE,Doesn't that over-buff buffoon ever get off stage? 
13,02,82,JAMES,"He's in a movie with no one to yell ""cut""! "
13,02,83,MEOWTH,Would you two stooges stop moaning about Mr. Ego and check out that marvelous Mr. Mime? 
13,02,84,JESSIE,Marvelous? Why? 
13,02,85,MEOWTH,Because those Mr. Mime-ish eyes are the eyes of a natural-born champion! 
13,02,86,JAMES,You see that? 
13,02,87,MEOWTH,"Let's go watch them duke it out, and you'll see, too! "
13,02,88,DAWN,I wonder what kind of battle it's going to be. 
13,02,89,PIPLUP,[CURIOUS] 
13,02,90,PIKACHU,[CURIOUS] 
13,02,91,BROCK,It all depends on how Buizel goes up against a Psychic type like Mr. Mime! 
13,02,92,CLAYTON,All right! Give me your best! 
13,02,93,ASH,"Let's do it, Buizel! Use Aqua Jet! "
13,02,94,BUIZEL,[AQUA JET MOVE] 
13,02,95,CLAYTON,"Mr. Mime, Psychic, go! MR. "
13,02,96,MIME,[PSYCHIC MOVE] 
13,02,97,BUIZEL,[IMPACT] 
13,02,98,ASH,"No, Buizel!  "
13,02,99,PIKACHU,[CONCERNED] 
13,02,100,ASH,"Buizel, you okay? "
13,02,101,BUIZEL,[REASSURING] 
13,02,102,CLAYTON,Attacking us head on shows me you've got real guts! I like that! 
13,02,103,ASH,"Whoa! They're strong, but I'm not going to lose! "
13,02,104,BROCK,Mr. Mime will just dodge all of Buizel's att*cks! 
13,02,105,ASH,Buizel! Use Sonic Boom! 
13,02,106,BUIZEL,[SONIC BOOM MOVE] 
13,02,107,CLAYTON,"Double Team, now! MR. "
13,02,108,MIME,[DOUBLE TEAM MOVE] 
13,02,109,ASH,Use Aqua Jet one more time! 
13,02,110,BUIZEL,[AQUA JET MOVE] 
13,02,111,BROCK,"Uh-oh! Hey, Ash, it's a trap! Look out! "
13,02,112,CLAYTON,"So! We'll finish this off with an expl*sive fist! Mr. Mime, Thunder Punch! MR. "
13,02,113,MIME,[THUNDER PUNCH MOVE] 
13,02,114,BUIZEL,[STUNNED] 
13,02,115,ASH,Buizel! 
13,02,116,CLAYTON,This battle is over! And that makes it bat-over for short! 
13,02,117,JESSIE,Mr. Mime is marvelous! 
13,02,118,JAMES,But the bloke's abbreviations make me climb the proverbial walls! Bat-over sounds like a baseball game! 
13,02,119,MEOWTH,"Who cares? Concentrate on giving Mr. Mime to the Boss as a gift, and you'll go a long way to give our money a lift! "
13,02,120,JESSIE,He's talking funny! We're making money! Who cares? 
13,02,121,JAMES,Catching that marvelous Mr. Mime's not a certainty. 
13,02,122,MEOWTH,Which is why you leave the details to me! 
13,02,123,JESSIE,"Great, we'll see. "
13,02,124,ASH,"Are you okay, Buizel? "
13,02,125,PIKACHU,[CONCERNED]  
13,02,126,PIPLUP,[CONCERNED] 
13,02,127,ASH,"I feel really bad, Buizel. Guess I got a little carried away. "
13,02,128,CLAYTON,"So, Ash-Bui! "
13,02,129,ASH,[SURPRISED] 
13,02,130,CLAYTON,"So tell me, what is the most important thing in a Pokémon battle? Now think! The secret lies deep within a lake and the capacity to stop its water! "
13,02,131,DAWN,Its water? I'm clueless! 
13,02,132,CLAYTON,I mean your mind! A mind that is undisturbed by the wind will conquer the flow of water! That is the secret art of the battle! 
13,02,133,ASH,I get it. Maybe. 
13,02,134,BUIZEL,[INSISTENT] 
13,02,135,CLAYTON,Of course! You want to train with me! 
13,02,136,ASH,"Yeah, and I want to train, too! So won't you please teach me everything you know, Chancellor? "
13,02,137,DAWN,He means it! 
13,02,138,CLAYTON,"It won't be easy! Do you think you have what it takes, Ash-Bui? "
13,02,139,ASH,For sure!  
13,02,140,BUIZEL,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,02,141,CLAYTON,That's good enough for me! 
13,02,142,ASH,"Thanks a lot, Clayton! "
13,02,143,BUIZEL,[GRATEFUL] 
13,02,144,ASH,What kind of training are we going to do? 
13,02,145,BUIZEL,[CURIOUS] 
13,02,146,CLAYTON,Take a look over there! 
13,02,147,ASH,"Yeah, what? "
13,02,148,CLAYTON,"You see, a battle is a collision of fists! So Ash-Bui will learn to master this move! Mr. Mime! MR. "
13,02,149,MIME,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,02,150,CLAYTON,"Ice Punch, let's go, now! MR. "
13,02,151,MIME,[ICE PUNCH MOVE] 
13,02,152,ASH,"Ice Punch, wow! "
13,02,153,DAWN,That is awesome! 
13,02,154,BROCK,The water froze in one punch! 
13,02,155,CLAYTON,Ash-Bui! You punch the water until your mind draws a blank! Then you will be able to master Ice Punch! So! Your turn! 
13,02,156,ASH,Right!  
13,02,157,BUIZEL,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,02,158,ASH,[EXERTION] 
13,02,159,CLAYTON,Think about your form as well! You won't be able to master it that way! 
13,02,160,ASH,"Yes, sir! "
13,02,161,JESSIE,Since when does the Trainer train along with the trainee? 
13,02,162,JAMES,"Well, training Twerps wrote the manual on extra help! They're pros at being powerless! "
13,02,163,MEOWTH,"Heads up, kids, I just bagged me a brainstorm! "
13,02,164,JAMES,Speak! 
13,02,165,MEOWTH,"Let's consider Mr. Mime! No doubt the Twerp's going to ask Loudmouth for a rousing rematch, and as soon as he does, Mr. Mime's bound to start wearing out and getting ready for some serious sleepy snoozing time! That's when we swoop in for the catch! "
13,02,166,JESSIE,"Why yes, natch! "
13,02,167,DAWN,I thought this would be a new way to train. 
13,02,168,PIKACHU,[CONFUSED]  
13,02,169,PIPLUP,[CONFUSED] 
13,02,170,CLAYTON,You're doing it all wrong! 
13,02,171,CLAYTON,You'll never be able to master Ice Punch as long as you insist on punching weakly like that! 
13,02,172,ASH,"So then, how do you do it? "
13,02,173,CLAYTON,Like this! 
13,02,174,BROCK,Look at the water! It didn't even splash! 
13,02,175,ASH,No way! Your fist didn't even get wet! 
13,02,176,CLAYTON,"Mastering Ice Punch requires intensive concentration as well as speed! Simply punching away isn't going to do anything! You must keep that in mind if you want to master Ice Punch, you see? "
13,02,177,ASH,I think so. 
13,02,178,CLAYTON,"Then you just keep training, Ash-Bui! Mr. Mime, let's go! MR. "

13,02,193,ASH,Whoa! 
13,02,194,ASH,"The speed of your punch must have cooled down your fist, and that made it freeze! Concentrate a little more, and you'll be able to do it, I'm sure! "
13,02,195,BUIZEL,[EXCITED] 
13,02,196,ASH,"Now, what else can we come up with to get Buizel's concentration all charged up? MR. "

13,02,202,MIME,[AGREEMENT] 
13,02,203,DAWN,Unbe-good? 
13,02,204,CLAYTON,Considering we eat berries and nothing more! 
13,02,205,DAWN,Just berries? Seriously? 
13,02,206,CLAYTON,"Yes, but this is delicious! It's unbe-licious for short! "
13,02,207,JESSIE,Hun-empty-tum. 
13,02,208,JAMES,You're hungry with an empty tummy? 
13,02,209,JESSIE,Hun-empty-tum. 
13,02,210,JAMES,"Right! Weird abbreviations can be contagious. Oh please, Meowth, can we catch Mr. Mime and get out of this place? I'm hun-empty-tum, just like her! "
13,02,211,MEOWTH,We're no match against that Mr. Mime unless that dynamo runs out of gas! Of course I'd abbreviate it to no-ma for short! 
13,02,212,JAMES,Of course! Most little brains would. 
13,02,213,DAWN,"Aren't you going to eat, Ash? "
13,02,214,ASH,Yeah... 
13,02,215,PIKACHU,[CONCERNED]

13,02,219,DAWN,"Ash, where are you going? "
13,02,220,BROCK,"Ash is so preoccupied with mastering Ice Punch, he doesn't want to eat. "
13,02,221,CLAYTON,"Ash-Bui has potential, so you don't have to worry about them. In short, I would say no-wo! And I'd like seconds please! And in short, that's sec-plea! "
13,02,222,BROCK,No...no-wo? 
13,02,223,DAWN,Sec-plea? Okay... 
13,02,224,ASH,"Hey, look at that... "
13,02,225,ASH,That's it! That'll work! 
13,02,226,ASH,"Being Buizel's Trainer, I can't let things stay stuck like this for long! That's for sure. "
13,02,227,ASH,"We're going to lick this! So let's master Ice Punch no matter what it takes, okay? "

13,02,235,BUIZEL,[FOCUSED] / [EXERTION] 
13,02,236,ASH,"Just letting loose with a punch won't do anything! You've got to pinpoint your punch to hit the moving leaf, get it? That'll increase your concentration and make your punch a lot more powerful! Try it again! "

13,02,256,CLAYTON,"So, are you saying that you've mastered Ice Punch, Ash-Bui? "
13,02,257,ASH,Yeah!

13,02,259,DAWN,"Ash, are you all right? "
13,02,260,ASH,Of course! You just watch us! 
13,02,261,CLAYTON,I accept! Challenge on! 
13,02,262,JESSIE,I'm hearing some thunder bumpers. 
13,02,263,JAMES,And they usually signify sheets of showers! 
13,02,264,MEOWTH,"Catching Mr. Mime in the rain is going to be like trying to catch the rain itself! There's no time to waste, so let's make haste! "
13,02,265,JAMES,I don't detect any prudent planning in that! Wait! 
13,02,266,JESSIE,"Hand over Mr. Mime, and do it on our time! "
13,02,267,ASH,You guys! 
13,02,268,JESSIE,The fact I'm a girl should be quite clear! 
13,02,269,JAMES,And this guy and gal will fill you with fear! 
13,02,270,JESSIE,On the wind! 
13,02,271,JAMES,Past the stars! 
13,02,272,JESSIE,"Abbreviated mottos stink, too! "
13,02,273,MEOWTH,"Since we didn't catch Mr. Mime, we've got lots of time! "
13,02,274,JAMES,Perhaps we could forge an abbreviated blastoff. 
13,02,275,JESSIE,We-bla-off-aaah! 
13,02,276,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,02,277,ASH,"All right, let's get going, okay? "

13,02,292,BROCK,"Come on, Ash! You can't b*at him by using the same move as before! "
13,02,293,CLAYTON,"Bro-Bree's right about that! The time has come for you to show me your Ice Punch, Ash-Bui! "
13,02,294,ASH,"Let's show them, Buizel! Ice Punch, let's go! "
13,02,295,BUIZEL,[ICE PUNCH MOVE] 
13,02,296,BROCK,All right! Looking good!

13,02,304,BUIZEL,[CONFIDENT] 
13,02,305,ASH,Let's go! 
13,02,306,ASH,"Hey, Clayton! The real battle is just getting started! "
13,02,307,CLAYTON,"I had a feeling you'd say that, Ash-Bui! I agree! So now we're battling fist to fist! Okay! We're making the first move, Mr. Mime, and that's Thunder Punch! MR. "
13,02,308,MIME,[THUNDER PUNCH MOVE]

13,02,312,CLAYTON,Where'd that incredible speed come from? 
13,02,313,BROCK,Swift Swim! That's Buizel's Ability! The rain increased Buizel's speed! 
13,02,314,ASH,"Quick, Buizel, I want you to get as close as you can! "
13,02,315,ASH,"All right, Buizel, use Ice Punch! "

13,02,323,BUIZEL,[PLEASED] 
13,02,324,BROCK,A leaf? 
13,02,325,ASH,Yeah! I thought of it while we were training! 
13,02,326,BROCK,It was a great idea to focus Buizel's energy on a single point that constantly moved around! Buizel's concentration got sharper! And that's why Buizel was able to master Ice Punch in such a short time! 
13,02,327,CLAYTON,"Though there's more to it than that, Bro-Bree. "
13,02,328,CLAYTON,"Ash-Bui used the sudden rain to their advantage! And then, they used Swift Swim, which increases Buizel's speed! Buizel defeated Mr. Mime because Buizel was faster! And that's just one reason why Pokémon battles are so extraordinary and thrilling! "
13,02,329,ASH,"Clayton, thanks a lot! "
13,02,330,CLAYTON,"Ash-Bui, you make me proud. I knew you both had it in you! "
13,02,331,BUIZEL,[GRATEFUL]

13,01,150,JENNY,I'm sure there's never been a Magnezone or a Metagross in this town before! 
13,01,151,DAWN,Magnezone att*cked us on the mountain trail. 
13,01,152,BROCK,The mountain. 
13,01,153,ASH,Maybe there's something up on the mountain! 
13,01,154,BROCK,Dear Jenny! Leave everything to me. I'll sort it out if it's the last thing I do! 
13,01,155,DAWN,That's great. So how are you going to do that? 
13,01,156,BROCK,"First, we use electricity to lure them to the mountain! "
13,01,157,JENNY,Good idea! No doubt some Electric-type moves will keep Magnezone and Metagross focused where we want! 
13,01,158,ASH,"Yeah! What do you say, buddy? "
13,01,159,PIKACHU,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,01,160,DAWN,"And we're ready, too! "
13,01,161,DAWN,Pachirisu will give us a hand! 
13,01,162,ASH,Pikachu! Thunderbolt! 
13,01,163,DAWN,Pachirisu! Discharge! 
13,01,164,PIKACHU,[att*ck] 
13,01,165,BROCK,I thought that would bring those two here! 
13,01,166,ASH,You're right! 
13,01,167,BROCK,"So, let's stick to our plan. "
13,01,168,ASH,"Okay! Pikachu and Pachirisu, let's head towards the mountain! "
13,01,169,PIKACHU,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,01,170,PACHIRISU,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,01,171,PIKACHU,[att*ck] 
13,01,172,MAGNEZONE,[FOCUSED] 
13,01,173,ASH,"Good work, Pikachu! "
13,01,174,DAWN,"Keep it up, Pachirisu! "
13,01,175,ASH,Awesome! Just a little further! 
13,01,176,PIKACHU,[THUNDERBOLT MOVE] 
13,01,177,BROCK,[SHOCKED] 
13,01,178,ASH,What was that? 
13,01,179,JESSIE,"What was, is now, and ever shall be! "
13,01,180,JAMES,"For you, that means trouble, just you wait and see! - "
13,01,181,JESSIE,On the wind! - 
13,01,182,JAMES,Past the stars! 
13,01,183,MEOWTH,Whoop-dee-dee! 
13,01,184,JESSIE,Bringing chaos at a breakneck pace! 
13,01,185,JAMES,"Dashing hope, putting fear in its place! "
13,01,186,JESSIE,A rose by any other name's just as sweet! 
13,01,187,JAMES,"When everything's worse, our work is complete - "
13,01,188,JESSIE,Jessie! - 
13,01,189,JAMES,And it's James! 
13,01,190,MEOWTH,"Meowth, that's a name! "
13,01,191,JESSIE,Putting the do-gooders in their place! 
13,01,192,JAMES,We're Team Rocket! 
13,01,193,JESSIE,And we're in your face! 
13,01,194,ASH,Team Rocket? 
13,01,195,DAWN,"With evil plans, no doubt! "
13,01,196,JESSIE,Wrong! 
13,01,197,MEOWTH,"We got wronged, and we're ticked! "
13,01,198,JAMES,That Electric and Steel stinker stole away our toast and jam! 
13,01,199,JESSIE,"And twice we were tinkered with! Twice! One time, shame on you, but twice, shame on us! "
13,01,200,MEOWTH,Word up! So it's time for a little Magnezone and Metagross payback! 
13,01,201,BROCK,I know! Meowth could talk to them and ask them why they're both so upset. 
13,01,202,JENNY,[SHOCKED] 
13,01,203,MEOWTH,Mug to mug? 
13,01,204,JESSIE,Are you saying there's a pattern at work here? 
13,01,205,ASH,Yeah! Both of them are making a mess in town! 
13,01,206,JESSIE,"Time out! Say we get to the bottom of this mess. Then, if we apply a little diplomacy, we could end up with twin titans for Team Rocket! "
13,01,207,MEOWTH,Wow! Sound logic! 
13,01,208,JAMES,"And it came from you! ""Twin titans"" has a nice ring! "
13,01,209,MEOWTH,"It's a deal, Twerps! I'll go have a powwow with those two punks and shake them down! "
13,01,210,METAGROSS,[FOCUSED] 
13,01,211,BROCK, Of course ...can we trust them? 
13,01,212,MEOWTH,"Yoohoo! I was hoping I could pick your brains and ask why you're on the warpath, dig? See, I've got a little bet with my buddies in the balloon here. "
13,01,213,MAGNEZONE,[ANNOYED] 
13,01,214,METAGROSS,[ANNOYED] 
13,01,215,MEOWTH,Stop with the metal mumbling and make sense! 
13,01,216,MAGNEZONE,[ANNOYED] 
13,01,217,ASH,Hey! What're they saying? 
13,01,218,JESSIE,It would help if you cleared the air. 
13,01,219,MEOWTH,I couldn't cop a crumb of that mumbo-jumbo! 
13,01,220,JESSIE,Mumbo-jumbo? 
13,01,221,MEOWTH,"They're mad, all right. But it's gobbledygook! "
13,01,222,BROCK,Even Meowth can't help! 
13,01,223,METAGROSS,[att*ck] 
13,01,224,JESSIE,Rejected by rabble-rousers! 
13,01,225,BROCK,"Well, that's that. So, let's finish taking them to the mountain. At least the town will be safe! "
13,01,226,ASH,"Got it! Pikachu, ready? "
13,01,227,PIKACHU,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,01,228,PIKACHU,[att*ck] 
13,01,229,JESSIE,"Heads up! Soon as we figure out their problem, we'll go therapeutic on them! Then take the twins for our trouble! "
13,01,230,JAMES,Check! 
13,01,231,PIKACHU,[att*ck] 
13,01,232,CRISPIN,Magnezone and Metagross! There you two are! 
13,01,233,ASH,Hi! We're trying to figure out what's with this Magnezone and Metagross. 
13,01,234,JENNY,Who are you? 
13,01,235,CRISPIN,Pleased to meet you! My name's Crispin. My job is to patrol this mountain. I'm at your service! 
13,01,236,CRISPIN,The basin is full now. 
13,01,237,CRISPIN,"But this is the exception, since it's usually quite empty! "
13,01,238,CRISPIN,Magnezone and Metagross used to battle quite a bit here. They would hurl themselves at each other like wrestlers! 
13,01,239,BROCK,That sounds intense! 
13,01,240,CRISPIN,It is! This mountain is full of locations that occasionally give off strange magnetic energy! 
13,01,241,CRISPIN,"That energy gets trapped in their bodies, and then it all needs to be released! So they battle each other as a way of doing just that. "
13,01,242,ASH,Wow! 
13,01,243,CRISPIN,"However, as soon as the basin filled up with water a few days ago, the two of them simply disappeared. "
13,01,244,CRISPIN,"The thing is, I worry ...if they fly into town with all that trapped energy, they could very well cause trouble, so I went looking! "
13,01,245,JENNY,I'm afraid it's already been happening! 
13,01,246,DAWN,It seems to me the trick is for someone to drain this basin! 
13,01,247,CRISPIN,Yeah! They could battle here and not have to go anywhere else! 
13,01,248,JESSIE,"While Twerps tarry, we save the day! "
13,01,249,JAMES,"So a-draining we will go! Although not mandatory, one hopes they'll show their thanks by joining our team. "
13,01,250,MEOWTH,"First, we've got a job to do! Whatever reason that pool is pooling, we'll clean up the drink, and we ain't fooling! "
13,01,251,BROCK,"There must be an explanation why the basin's so full! I suggest, before we do anything, we figure that out first. "
13,01,252,JESSIE,Let go! I can't breathe! 
13,01,253,ASH,"Pikachu and Pachirisu! Do you think you could keep those two hanging around a little while longer, please? "
13,01,254,PIKACHU,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,01,255,PACHIRISU,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,01,256,PIKACHU,[att*ck] 
13,01,257,MAGNEZONE,[FOCUSED] 
13,01,258,CRISPIN,"I know there have been some major rainstorms this past week, but they couldn't have caused all this! "
13,01,259,ASH,Then that means water must be coming in from somewhere else! 
13,01,260,CRISPIN,Right! 
13,01,261,PIPLUP,[CURIOUS] / [INSISTENT] 
13,01,262,DAWN,A stream! 
13,01,263,BROCK,Let's follow it! 
13,01,264,ASH,Yeah! 
13,01,265,BROCK,There's your reason! That boulder's blocking the river's water flow! 
13,01,266,DAWN,Which means the overflow's flooding out the basin! 
13,01,267,CRISPIN,"We've got to move that boulder, quick! "
13,01,268,JESSIE,"Out of the way, nudniks! "
13,01,269,CRISPIN,[SURPRISED] 
13,01,270,JESSIE,"Move your sorry selves, and let the experts handle your toughest water problems! "
13,01,271,MEOWTH,Time for rock liftoff! 
13,01,272,JAMES,Danger! Too much heft! 
13,01,273,JESSIE,"Well, show them what's left! "
13,01,274,BROCK,Dear Jenny ... 
13,01,275,BROCK,"I beg you, please leave this to me! "
13,01,276,JENNY,"Uh, well ... "
13,01,277,BROCK,"Croagunk, come out! We need you! "
13,01,278,CROAGUNK,[CROAKING] 
13,01,279,BROCK,All right. Use Brick Break on that rock! 
13,01,280,CROAGUNK,[BRICK BREAK MOVE] 
13,01,281,JENNY,Amazing! 
13,01,282,BROCK,Of course! That's what happens when you leave it to me! 
13,01,283,JENNY,"Croagunk, you were great! "
13,01,284,ASH,All right! So that takes care of that river flow! 
13,01,285,DAWN,Now for the water. 
13,01,286,JESSIE,Which means now for Team Rocket! 
13,01,287,JAMES,It hardly seems right to have a primed pump without a gig! 
13,01,288,MEOWTH,Check this rig! 
13,01,289,MEOWTH,We've got contact! 
13,01,290,JAMES,Juice! 
13,01,291,ASH,That motor sounds like this is going to take a while. 
13,01,292,DAWN,Maybe we could dig a tunnel underneath the basin. Then the water would drain right out! 
13,01,293,BROCK,Of course! Why not freeze the water instead? 
13,01,294,JENNY,Freeze it?[CONFUSED] 
13,01,295,DAWN,How would that work? 
13,01,296,BROCK,"Well, then we can just toss it! Hey, Dawn, do you think Buneary can handle this? "
13,01,297,DAWN,You've got it! 
13,01,298,DAWN,"Buneary, go! "
13,01,299,BUNEARY,[APPEARING] 
13,01,300,DAWN,"All right, Buneary, Ice Beam! "
13,01,301,BUNEARY,[ICE BEAM MOVE] 
13,01,302,JENNY,Wow! Excellent! 
13,01,303,BROCK,"Happiny, now! You're up next! "
13,01,304,HAPPINY,[APPEARING] 
13,01,305,HAPPINY,[EXERTION] 
13,01,306,DAWN,"Wow! Happiny, way to go! "
13,01,307,HAPPINY,[EXCITED] 
13,01,308,JESSIE,I'm getting ice-sick! 
13,01,309,BROCK,"Great work, Happiny! Now toss it into the valley! "
13,01,310,HAPPINY,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
13,01,311,JESSIE,You can't just throw us away like a used swizzle stick! 
13,01,312,JAMES,Recycle utensils! 
13,01,313,MEOWTH,"Don't be mean, think green! "
13,01,314,HAPPINY,[EXERTION] 
13,01,315,PIKACHU,[att*ck] 
13,01,316,ASH,"Pikachu, Pachirisu! "
13,01,317,ASH,"That's enough! Thanks, you two! "
13,01,318,PIKACHU,[TIRED] 
13,01,319,DAWN,Great job! You were awesome! 
13,01,320,ASH,You gave it your all! 
13,01,321,PIKACHU,[PLEASED] 
13,01,322,PACHIRISU,[PLEASED] 
13,01,323,ASH,"Hey, Magnezone, Metagross! You can battle as much as you like now, so don't worry! "
13,01,324,METAGROSS,[THANKFUL] 
13,01,325,MAGNEZONE,[BATTLING] 
13,01,326,ASH,"Wow, check out that power! "
13,01,327,DAWN,"Yeah, they're something! "
13,01,328,JENNY,"As long as they're battling here, they can do whatever they like! "
13,01,329,MAGNEZONE METAGROSS,[BATTLING] 
13,01,330,JESSIE,"Look, Meowth, you know what to do! Talk them into joining! "
13,01,331,MEOWTH,Right! It's a gift! 
13,01,332,MEOWTH,Excuse me! How about taking a pause for the cause and hearing me out? 
13,01,333,MEOWTH,"I know the evidence! I know the way it looks! It appears those Twerps fixed everything that was going wrong for you, but truth be told, it was us! "
13,01,334,MEOWTH,We gave them Twerpies the wisdom and courage to step up to the old plate! 
13,01,335,MEOWTH,"And since it was Team Rocket solving all of your problemos and making it a bright sunshiny day, I think it's only fitting that you should join Team Rocket! "
13,01,336,JESSIE,Excellent! Do you think they're in? 
13,01,337,JAMES,I hope you crossed your T's and dotted your I's! 
13,01,338,MEOWTH,Good! They bought the jive! The dream's alive! 
13,01,339,MAGNEZONE,[att*ck] 
13,01,340,METAGROSS,[att*ck] 
13,01,341,JAMES,"Drat! And on top of it all, I still haven't enjoyed one taste of my toast and jam! "
13,01,342,JESSIE,You and your stomach. You're a pathetic pair! 
13,01,343,MEOWTH,I thought I was so slick! And what do we we get? 
13,01,344,JESSIE,We're blasting off again! 
13,01,345,JENNY,"Finally! It looks like everything's back to normal! I think I'll head back into town now, calm everybody down! "
13,01,346,CRISPIN,Thank you for a great job! 
13,01,347,METAGROSS,[BATTLING] 
13,01,348,ASH,Man! I just can't wait a second longer! 
13,01,349,ASH,"Gible, I choose you! "
13,01,350,GIBLE,[APPEARING] 
13,01,351,ASH,"Aww, not again! Hey! Knock it off! "
13,01,352,ASH,"Gible, Draco Meteor, let's go! "
13,01,353,GIBLE,[DRACO METEOR MOVE]

13,01,357,PIPLUP,[SCARED] 
13,01,358,DAWN,"Piplup! Be careful, okay? "
13,01,359,ASH,"This is getting kind of old! Gible, stop! "
13,01,360,PIPLUP,[SCARED] 
13,01,361,NARRATOR,"And so, thanks to our heroes, Magnezone and Metagross are back home, and happily battling! "
13,01,362,NARRATOR,"And yes, Daybreak Town and Dawn's next contest are closer than ever, so stay tuned"
12,53,0,NARRATOR,"As our heroes make their way toward Daybreak Town and Dawn's next Pokémon Contest, the peace and quiet of the forest is about to be rudely interrupted. "
12,53,1,JESSIE,The glorious day has come! 
12,53,2,JAMES,When we unveil our ultra-expensive new Blastobot Two! 
12,53,3,MEOWTH,Proving a Pikachu in the paw is worth two for the Twerp! Who's that? 
12,53,4,JAMES,It's the Gible we had a recent run-in with. 
12,53,5,GIBLE,[THREATENING] 
12,53,6,JESSIE,"Move it, squat little squirt! "
12,53,7,GIBLE,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
12,53,8,JAMES,"You said that you would, now time to make good! "
12,53,9,GIBLE,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
12,53,10,MEOWTH,I got just the thing to get you trembling on those tiny feet! Blastobot! 
12,53,11,GIBLE,[DETERMINED] 
12,53,12,MEOWTH,Quit munching the merchandise! 
12,53,13,JAMES,Stop! 
12,53,14,JESSIE,Those are not empty calories! 
12,53,15,MEOWTH,Taste good? 
12,53,16,GIBLE,[SATISFIED] 
12,53,17,PIKACHU,[SURPRISED] 
12,53,18,MEOWTH,That jerk has got ostentatious-itis! 
12,53,19,JESSIE,Ostentatious-itis? 
12,53,20,MEOWTH,It's where you're so stuck up you're sick! 
12,53,21,JAMES,Say! Perhaps ostentatious-itis is the very affliction that may teach one of us how not to behave in the future! 
12,53,22,JESSIE,Ah! How I love learning! As long as it's not me being taught! 
12,53,23,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",While we're blasting off again! 
12,53,24,WOBBUFFET,"[AFFIRMATIVE] Sometimes it's hard to know, Which way you're supposed to go. But deep inside, you know you're strong. If you follow your heart, you can't be wrong. Stand up! [Stand up!] For what is right. Be brave! Get ready to fight. Hold on! [Hold on!] We're friends for life. And if we come, together as one, Complete the quest, that we've begun, We will win the battle! Galactic Battles! Pokémon! "
12,53,25,ASH,"Yes! A town, and that means food! What do you say we get something to eat, Pikachu? "
12,53,26,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
12,53,27,DAWN,We need to go to the Pokémon Center first! 
12,53,28,BROCK,So! Pokégear? Help us find the location! 
12,53,29,GIBLE,[PLAYFUL] 
12,53,30,ASH,"Whoa! Hey, Pikachu, did you just poke my leg? "
12,53,31,ASH,That's strange Who's that? 
12,53,32,BROCK,"What's wrong, Ash? "
12,53,33,ASH,Someone keeps poking my leg. Weird! 
12,53,34,"DAWN, BROCK, PIKACHU",[SURPRISED] 
12,53,35,DAWN,Look who's here! 
12,53,36,BROCK,"Wow, that's the same Gible who's Grandma Wilma's friend! "
12,53,37,GIBLE,[AFFECTIONATE] 
12,53,38,BROCK,Gible sure looks happy chomping on your head. 
12,53,39,DAWN,"Ash, I'll bet you anything this Gible likes you lots! "
12,53,40,BROCK,"Gible was awfully happy when it learned Draco Meteor the other day, and it was all because of working - so hard with you! - "
12,53,41,ASH,"Are they right, Gible? "
12,53,42,GIBLE,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
12,53,43,ASH,Do you want to come with me?

12,53,47,"PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[SHOCKED] 
12,53,48,DAWN,No way!

12,53,50,"BROCK, DAWN, PIPLUP, PIKACHU",[CONFUSED] 
12,53,51,ASH,"Wait! So you don't want to come with me, Gible? "
12,53,52,GIBLE,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
12,53,53,ASH,But you just said you did! 
12,53,54,GIBLE,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
12,53,55,ASH,"Make up your mind, Gible, which is it? "
12,53,56,GIBLE,[AFFECTIONATE] 
12,53,57,"DAWN, BROCK, PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[CONFUSED] 
12,53,58,BROCK,Officer Jenny! Your siren is nothing compared to the siren in my heart when confronted with your beauty! Put me under arrest with those eyes Later. 
12,53,59,OFFICER JENNY,"So this is your Gible, right? "
12,53,60,ASH,"Well, you see "
12,53,61,GIBLE,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
12,53,62,OFFICER JENNY,"It's nodding yes, so it's yours, right? "
12,53,63,GIBLE,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
12,53,64,ASH,"See, but it's not! "
12,53,65,OFFICER JENNY,It can't be yes and no. 
12,53,66,GIBLE,[AGGRESSIVE] - 
12,53,67,OFFICER JENNY,Stop! - 
12,53,68,ASH,"Cut it out, Gible! "
12,53,69,ASH,"Man! Come on, Gible! "
12,53,70,OFFICER JENNY,"Young man, I do think you need to look after your Pokémon a bit better in the future! "
12,53,71,ASH,"The truth is, I was just trying to catch it when you showed up, but no luck! "
12,53,72,DAWN,This Gible is still a wild Pokémon at this point! 
12,53,73,OFFICER JENNY,"Oh, I see. "
12,53,74,BROCK,"So, Jenny, is something not right? "
12,53,75,OFFICER JENNY,"I'll show you, but you won't believe it. Come have a look! "
12,53,76,ASH,What happened here? 
12,53,77,DAWN,Everything has a bite taken out of it! - 
12,53,78,BROCK,This is awful! - 
12,53,79,ASH,"Hey, it's Gible! "
12,53,80,GIBLE,[GREETING] 
12,53,81,ASH,Now tell the truth! Did you do all of this? 
12,53,82,GIBLE,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
12,53,83,ASH,"Well, what you did is really bad! "
12,53,84,GIBLE,[AGGRESSIVE] 
12,53,85,ASH,"Look, I told you to knock it off, Gible! Gible, you're causing a whole lot of trouble to a lot of people, see? Don't ever do that again! "
12,53,86,ASH,"You're driving me crazy with all of this biting stuff! Didn't you hear anything I'm telling you, Gible? "
12,53,87,DAWN,"Uh, no. "
12,53,88,GIBLE,[EXERTION] - 
12,53,89,ASH,"Gible, slow down! - "
12,53,90,OFFICER JENNY,Come back!

12,53,92,DAWN,"Whoa, it's Barry! "
12,53,93,BROCK,"Hey, are you two all right? "
12,53,94,BARRY,"All right, Ash, what's with you? I'm fining you for getting in my way! Pay up in ten seconds! Nine, eight, seven, six... "
12,53,95,ASH,You're the one who slammed into me! 
12,53,96,BARRY,"Well, you're the one who didn't move! "
12,53,97,ASH,Maybe you should learn how to ride a bike! 
12,53,98,BARRY,Forget it! Let's have a Pokémon battle! Have you gotten any better? 
12,53,99,ASH,Sure! Lots better than you! 
12,53,100,BARRY,So how many badges have you won? 
12,53,101,ASH,Seven of them! 
12,53,102,BARRY,"Poor Ash! You've only got seven, huh? "
12,53,103,ASH,How many do you have? 
12,53,104,BARRY,"Keep your shirt on! Six, see? - "
12,53,105,ASH,"Yeah, I see. - "
12,53,106,DAWN,Six is less than seven. 
12,53,107,BARRY,"It doesn't matter how many badges I have! I'm way more talented than Ash anyway, get it? "
12,53,108,ASH,"Yeah? All right, then, let's battle! "
12,53,109,BARRY,"You're on, kid! "
12,53,110,BROCK,Now! Let's all take a deep breath. 
12,53,111,DAWN,"Good idea! But Barry, last we talked to you, you said you were headed to Sunyshore City, right? "
12,53,112,BARRY,"I was headed for Sunyshore City, but then I heard that Eterna City was giving away bikes for free, so I thought I'd go there first! "
12,53,113,DAWN,Bicycles for free? 
12,53,114,BARRY,"After that, I stopped by the Hearthome City Gym to challenge Fantina to a battle, but she wasn't there. - Again! - "
12,53,115,ASH,Surprise! 
12,53,116,BARRY,"But check this! See? I've got me a genuine Hearthome City Gym Challenger ticket, and I'm first in line! "
12,53,117,ASH,"Gee, Barry, that's too bad you haven't been able to get a Relic Badge yet, huh? "
12,53,118,BARRY,"For your information, I haven't had the time to battle Fantina yet! But now that I have a bike, I'll really be able to move. Hey, where did my bike go? "
12,53,119,GIBLE,[SATISFIED] 
12,53,120,BARRY,I can't believe that you would have the nerve to eat my bicycle! I'm going to fine you 
12,53,121,JESSIE,Guess bikes are on the menu as well. 
12,53,122,MEOWTH,"hat gormandizing Gible would make a gloriously, groovy gift for the boss ya know. "
12,53,123,JAMES,"Well, at least he's not made out of metal. "
12,53,124,MEOWTH,Be creative and think outside the box for a change! Picture the Boss having to go through the annoying inventory of outdated weaponry thrown out on the scrapheap of Team Rocket rubble! Boring and scary! 
12,53,125,MEOWTH,"Now dig! Team Rocket may deny the evils of truth and love, but we don't ever dump recyclables! Even Pokémon thieves gotta be responsible citizens of the planet! And that's where our Gible will come in mightily handy! "
12,53,126,GIOVANNI [MEOWTH] ,Yeah! 
12,53,127,"GIBLE, [MEOWTH] ",[DETERMINED] 
12,53,128,GIOVANNI [MEOWTH],"Thanks to the gift of Gible by Meowth and friends, I can keep it clean and make it green! And now it's time to give them the gift of green, if you know what I mean. "
12,53,129,MEOWTH,"Ready, kids? "
12,53,130,"JESSIE, JAMES",Save the planet. Grab that Gible. Make a lot of dough! 
12,53,131,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
12,53,132,JAMES,We'll go green and be rolling in green while the Twerps are green with envy! 
12,53,133,BARRY,I want a brand-new bike right now! 
12,53,134,ASH,"I told you not to do that, didn't I, Gible? "
12,53,135,GIBLE,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
12,53,136,ASH,You understand any of this? 
12,53,137,BARRY,What a piece of work! Ever heard of training your Pokémon to have some manners? 
12,53,138,BROCK,"To be honest, Ash hasn't caught this Gible just yet. - "
12,53,139,DAWN,It's a wild Pokémon! - 
12,53,140,BARRY,"It's wild? If that's the case, I'm going to catch this Gible myself! Ready or not, here I come! "
12,53,141,ASH,"Hold on, Barry! "
12,53,142,BARRY,"Come on, come on, come on, what's wrong now? "
12,53,143,ASH,"I was planning on catching this Gible, Barry, see? "
12,53,144,BARRY,"It's first come, first served! Empoleon! "

12,53,242,JESSIE,I suggest that we toss the Twerp clean off the cliff! 
12,53,243,MEOWTH,"Uh, may I remind you that illegal dumping is totally against the law. "

12,53,262,MEOWTH,Junkyard? 
12,53,263,JESSIE,I guess we could've used proper wiring instead - of some old coat hangers. - 
12,53,264,MEOWTH,Coat hangers? 
12,53,265,MEOWTH,I wonder if you figured out who suffers from ostentatious-itis yet?

12,52,19,DAWN,"Whoa, what was that about? "
12,52,20,PIPLUP,[UPSET] 
12,52,21,GRANDMA WILMA,Children? 
12,52,22,GRANDMA WILMA,What are you doing out here? 
12,52,23,ASH,"See, we were walking through the forest when we saw this strange light flying through the skyand then... "
12,52,24,GRANDMA WILMA,It's called Draco Meteor. It's not strange! 
12,52,25,DAWN,Draco Meteor? 
12,52,26,BROCK,Then of course that means it was the work of a Pokémon! 
12,52,27,DAWN,So it must've been your Altaria! 
12,52,28,POKEDEX,"Altaria. The Humming Pokémon, and the evolved form of Swablu. As Altaria flies across the sky, it resembles a soft cloud. It hums using its high voice. "
12,52,29,GRANDMA WILMA,"Well, I do believe that fate has brought us together today! I'm Grandma Wilma. Pleased to meet you! "
12,52,30,ASH,Hi! I'm Ash!

12,52,35,"PIPLUP, ALTARIA, PIKACHU",[PLAYFUL] 
12,52,36,ASH,"So you can only teach Dragon types, huh? "
12,52,37,GRANDMA WILMA,"Right! A Trainer left his Altaria with me so I could teach it Draco Meteor! But it's just a beginner, so who knows where the meteors fall... "
12,52,38,GRANDMA WILMA,"Of course, you can see why no one's allowed to pass through here! "
12,52,39,DAWN,"Yeah, I sure can. We're really sorry we just barged in! "
12,52,40,GRANDMA WILMA,"The important thing is that everyone is still in one piece! Right, Altaria? "
12,52,41,"ALTARIA, PIPLUP, PIKACHU",[HAPPY] 
12,52,42,GRANDMA WILMA,Smart as a whip! I'm sure Altaria will be able to graduate before you can say boo! 
12,52,43,ASH,It'd be awesome if you'd let us watch you two train a little bit! 
12,52,44,BROCK,I would be really interested in learning about the way you teach! 
12,52,45,DAWN,We'd really appreciate it! 
12,52,46,GRANDMA WILMA,"Of course! I'd be happy to! It's not a big secret, you know. "
12,52,47,ASH,That's great! Thank you! - 
12,52,48,DAWN,What's that? - 
12,52,49,BROCK,Is that... 
12,52,50,ASH,A Pokémon? 
12,52,51,GIBLE,[GREETING] 
12,52,52,BROCK,A Gible? 
12,52,53,GRANDMA WILMA,"Back again, I see! "
12,52,54,GRANDMA WILMA,"You see, this little Gible lives in the forest very near here! And it appears to me that it might be quite interested in all of you! "
12,52,55,ASH,How are you? I'm Ash... 
12,52,56,"BROCK, GIBLE",[AGGRESSIVE]

12,52,70,GRANDMA WILMA,"All right, that's enough for now. It's back to the forest for you! "
12,52,71,GIBLE,[EXERTION] 
12,52,72,DAWN,"Amazing, Grandma Wilma! "
12,52,73,GRANDMA WILMA,"Altaria, shall we get back to working on Draco Meteor? What do you say? "
12,52,74,ALTARIA,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
12,52,75,JESSIE,Well well... 
12,52,76,JAMES,That Altaria uses Draco Meteor? Meteoric! 
12,52,77,MEOWTH,"Draco Meteor rates a solid ten on the fierce move meter, and that's no jive! "
12,52,78,JESSIE,And abducting Altaria would bring Team Rocket alive! 
12,52,79,JESSIE,Allowing us to conquer Sinnoh by giving us that little extra drive! 
12,52,80,JAMES,So for what shall we strive? 
12,52,81,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",It's time to grab that gifted fluff and thrive! 
12,52,82,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
12,52,83,GRANDMA WILMA,"Now let's begin. First off, concentrate every bit of your energy, collecting your entire Dragon-type powers! "
12,52,84,ALTARIA,[FOCUSED] 
12,52,85,GRANDMA WILMA,"Then, direct all of those powers into the center of your body! "
12,52,86,GRANDMA WILMA,Now face the sky and let her rip! 
12,52,87,ALTARIA,[PROUD] 
12,52,88,GRANDMA WILMA,I would give that a ten out of ten! 
12,52,89,ALTARIA,[PLEASED] 
12,52,90,DAWN,So Draco Meteor's a really powerful move that works to make the most out of the special powers of Dragon-type Pokémon! 
12,52,91,BROCK,And the key to great training is to work hard on concentration and use it to build up those powers to the max! 
12,52,92,GIBLE,[DETERMINED] 
12,52,93,ASH,Gible? 
12,52,94,PIKACHU,[QUESTIONING] 
12,52,95,GIBLE,[FOCUSED] 
12,52,96,DAWN,"Wait, could that be Draco Meteor, too? "
12,52,97,BROCK,Could be! Gible is a Dragon type as well!

12,52,104,GIBLE,[APOLOGETIC] 
12,52,105,GRANDMA WILMA,"Well, uh...not quite... Gible's watching our work and trying to copy Altaria, you see. But that? That was less of a Draco Meteor than a meteor, plain and simple... "
12,52,106,ASH,"So then, why don't you give me a sh*t training Gible! What do you say? "
12,52,107,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
12,52,108,GIBLE,[EXCITED] 
12,52,109,ASH,"Okay, the first thing we need to do is concentrate and boost your Dragon-type power! "
12,52,110,GIBLE,[FOCUSED] 
12,52,111,ASH,Great! Now focus that power into the center of your body! 
12,52,112,ASH,All right! Draco Meteor!

12,52,119,ASH,"Now, guess we've got to boost Gible's energy even more, Gible, let's try it once more! "
12,52,120,PIPLUP,[SURPRISED] 
12,52,121,ASH,"Hey, Gible, what's wrong? "
12,52,122,GIBLE,[AGGRESSIVE] 
12,52,123,BROCK,I'd sure like to know what's going on in Gible's head when it does that... 
12,52,124,ASH,Thanks. Guess I needed that... 
12,52,125,GRANDMA WILMA,Patience and affection...those are the keys to mastering Draco Meteor.

12,52,158,GRANDMA WILMA,Hang on! Altaria's not my Pokémon! It belongs to a Trainer! Now give it back! 
12,52,159,JESSIE,"Silly! If we give Altaria back, then the stealing part is moot! "
12,52,160,MEOWTH,"Yeah, but if we hold on to it, we get big and strong! Sinnoh strong to last the whole region long! "

12,52,341,GIBLE,[PLEASED] 
12,52,342,ASH,"Hey, Gible, thank you! You were great out there! "
12,52,343,GIBLE,[HAPPY] 
12,52,344,DAWN,I'm impressed! Gible totally figured out how to use Draco Meteor! 
12,52,345,GIBLE,[DRACO METEOR MOVE]

12,52,349,PIPLUP,[STUNNED] 
12,52,350,GIBLE,[APOLOGETIC] 
12,52,351,BROCK,I guess that's the way it goes. You can't win them all! 
12,52,352,PIKACHU,[RESIGNED] 
12,52,353,GRANDMA WILMA,"See that road? Turn right there to go to Daybreak Town. Now don't get lost, you hear? "
12,52,354,ASH,Right! Hold on Where'd Gible go? 
12,52,355,BROCK,Good question. I know Gible was standing here just now. 
12,52,356,GRANDMA WILMA,It must've hightailed it back to the forest! 
12,52,357,GRANDMA WILMA,"Thank you! You were all such a big, big help! Be sure to stop by when you're in the neighborhood! "
12,52,358,DAWN,"We will, promise! "
12,52,359,PIKACHU,[FAREWELL] 
12,52,360,PIPLUP,[FAREWELL] - 
12,52,361,ASH,See you later! - 
12,52,362,DAWN,"Bye for now, Altaria! "
12,52,363,NARRATOR,"Thanks to our heroes, another Pokémon is safe from the evil clutches of Team Rocket, which allows Dawn to put her undivided attention toward Daybreak Town and her next Pokémon Contest! "
12,52,364,DAWN,"Think of it, Piplupour next contest! Ready to work hard? "
12,52,365,PIPLUP,[EXCITED]

12,51,2,MARIAN,"All right, it's the final stage of the Brussel Town Pokémon Contest! And we've got ourselves a real battle, as the face-off between Zoey's Glameow and Rebecca's Shuckle is at a fever pitch! "
12,51,3,DAWN,"Guys, hurry! "
12,51,4,PIPLUP,[AGREEING] 
12,51,5,DAWN,Of course you had to wait until the Contest started - to get us good and lost! - 
12,51,6,ASH,"Hey, come on Dawn, you're the one who told us to make a right. "
12,51,7,DAWN,That's not the truth Ash and you know it! 
12,51,8,ASH,It's the truth and you know it! 
12,51,9,CANDICE,We're getting to the good part! 
12,51,10,BROCK,Candice! 
12,51,11,CANDICE,We get to watch Zo Zo show everyone some real Kiai! 
12,51,12,NARRATOR,"En route to Daybreak Town and Dawn's next Contest challenge, our heroes have opted to stop by the Brussel Town Pokémon Contest, where things are really heating up! "
12,51,13,REBECCA,"All right Shuckle, Constrict, go! "

12,51,18,SHUCKLE,[WITHDRAW MOVE] 
12,51,19,MARIAN,"As Glameow unleashes a fierce Fury Swipes on Shuckle, a quick Withdraw allows Shuckle to safely hold its ground! Sometimes it's hard to know, Which way you're supposed to go. But deep inside, you know you're strong. If you follow your heart, you can't be wrong. Stand up! [Stand up!] For what is right. Be brave! Get ready to fight. Hold on! [Hold on!] We're friends for life. And if we come, together as one, Complete the quest, that we've begun, We will win the battle! Galactic Battles! Pokémon! "

12,51,24,REBECCA,Shuckle!

12,51,28,GLAMEOW,[PROUD] 
12,51,29,MARIAN,"Shuckle is unable to battle! Which makes our big winner, Zoey! "
12,51,30,ZOEY,"Glameow, we did it! "
12,51,31,GLAMEOW,[PROUD] 
12,51,32,CANDICE,"All right! Zo Zo can sure work that Kiai! Zo Zo won, Zo Zo won! "
12,51,33,DAWN,"Candice, great to see you! "
12,51,34,CANDICE,"Dawn, and Ash, and Brock too! Where did you all learn to sneak around like that? "
12,51,35,DAWN,Sneak around? Didn't you see us come in? 
12,51,36,CANDICE,"Nope. Dawn, how come you're not down there? "
12,51,37,DAWN,I'm competing in the Contest in Daybreak Town! But the minute I realized that Zoey's fifth and final Contest Ribbon was on the line I had to come and watch! 
12,51,38,CANDICE,A true friend! 
12,51,39,CONTESTA,"Zoey, congratulations! This is Ribbon number five, right? "
12,51,40,ZOEY,Right! 
12,51,41,CONTESTA,"You may now enter the Grand Festival! We'll look forward to seeing you there, soon! "
12,51,42,ZOEY,"Thanks very much, sir! Uh, may I say a few words? "
12,51,43,CONTESTA,"Yes, go right ahead! "
12,51,44,ZOEY,I'd like to give special thanks to Ms. Senior! Her cheers about Kiai mean the world! 
12,51,45,CANDICE,Oh Zo Zo you're the best! 
12,51,46,DAWN,"It's really great to see you again Candice, but shouldn't you be up at the Snowpoint Gym? "
12,51,47,CANDICE,No problem! Challengers rarely come to the Snowpoint Gym anyway! 
12,51,48,"ASH, DAWN, BROCK, PIPLUP, PIKACHU",[SHOCKED] 
12,51,49,JESSILINA [JESSIE],"Well! That annoying sunglasses, topped talking head of a Twerpette has got a glut of gall by getting her fifth Contest Ribbon before I do! "
12,51,50,JAMES,Being fired up is so you! 
12,51,51,MEOWTH,Rock them at the next Contest and show them who's who! 
12,51,52,JESSILINA [JESSIE],Cheese it! It's teeming with Twerps! 
12,51,53,ZOEY,Hey guys! Thanks so much for cheering for me on! - 
12,51,54,DAWN,"Zoey, congratulations! - "
12,51,55,BROCK,You were great! 
12,51,56,ASH,Now it's a straight line to the Grand Festival! 
12,51,57,ZOEY,"Ms. Senior, I can't thank you enough for all of your help! "
12,51,58,CANDICE,"Hey, don't forget you're the one with all that Kiai going on! But now Zo Zo it's time to have a party to end all parties! Yup! Here's to Zo Zo's big win! "
12,51,59,"ASH, DAWN, BROCK, ZOEY, CANDICE",Yeah! 
12,51,60,JAMES,Cowering in the bush is silly even for us! 
12,51,61,MEOWTH,Twerps wouldn't know us if we jumped out and said boo! 
12,51,62,JESSIE,They've elevated cluelessness to an art form. 
12,51,63,WOBBUFFET,[AGREEING] 
12,51,64,CANDICE,"Okay g*ng! To celebrate Zo Zo's Brussel Town Contest victory and entry into the Grand Festival, it's a sweets marathon! "
12,51,65,"ASH, DAWN, BROCK, ZOEY, CANDICE","So, let's eat! "
12,51,66,ZOEY,"So, how's everything with you, Dawn? "
12,51,67,DAWN,Great! Working hard! 
12,51,68,CANDICE,Dawn has her sights set on competing in the Daybreak Contest coming up! 
12,51,69,ZOEY,"Wait, you need two Pokémon each for the Performance and Battle rounds in the Daybreak Contest, right? "
12,51,70,DAWN,"Right, but the way I messed up the Double Performance at the Hearthome Contest, I really want to jump back in and challenge myself one more time! You remember what you told me back then, don't you? You said if you want to improve, you should never be satisfied with where you are! "
12,51,71,ZOEY,Now that's what I like to hear! See you at the Grand Festival final round! 
12,51,72,DAWN,You bet! 
12,51,73,BROCK,"Ash, what's wrong? - "
12,51,74,ASH,"Water, water water water! - "
12,51,75,DAWN,Here! 
12,51,76,ASH,That ice cream bar was sweet and spicy too! Now my tongue's kind of hot and cold... 
12,51,77,DAWN,How can your tongue be hot and cold? 
12,51,78,CANDICE,"It's a Snowpoint Tamato Berry Ice Cream Bar! Yummy ice cream outside, with Tamato Berry jelly on the inside! "
12,51,79,BROCK,It's spicy all right... 
12,51,80,DAWN,Why fill a bar with that? 
12,51,81,CANDICE,"See, sometimes certain things you'd never think would go together end up going together really well! - Dee-lish! - "
12,51,82,DAWN,I see! 
12,51,83,CANDICE,"So come on folks, eat up, eat up! The night is still young! "
12,51,84,"ASH, DAWN, BROCK, ZOEY",Okay! 
12,51,85,ASH,"Man, am I stuffed! "
12,51,86,PIKACHU,[AGREEING] 
12,51,87,BROCK,"Ash, are you sure you're all right? "
12,51,88,"ASH, PIKACHU",[CURIOUS] 
12,51,89,BROCK,Come in! 
12,51,90,ZOEY,I'm sorry about holding you up today. 
12,51,91,ASH,"Nah, we had a great time! "
12,51,92,BROCK,"I would imagine Candice is really happy about you moving on to the Grand Festival, isn't she? "
12,51,93,ZOEY,Yeah she sure is! She's great. Do you guys know where Dawn is? 
12,51,94,ASH,Dawn left here a little while ago! 
12,51,95,BROCK,She's got her Contest coming up soon so she's practicing alone. 
12,51,96,ZOEY,Wow! 
12,51,97,DAWN,"Great! That was awesome! Piplup, Buneary, you're up next! "
12,51,98,"PIPLUP, BUNEARY",[EXCITED] 
12,51,99,DAWN,"Now Piplup, use Bubblebeam! "
12,51,100,PIPLUP,[BUBBLEBEAM MOVE] 
12,51,101,DAWN,"Buneary, you use Ice Beam! "
12,51,102,BUNEARY,[ICE BEAM MOVE] 
12,51,103,"PIPLUP, PACHIRISU, BUNEARY",[AMAZED] 
12,51,104,DAWN,"Yeah, looking good! Pachirisu and Piplup, you're next! "
12,51,105,"PIPLUP, PACHIRISU",[EXCITED] 
12,51,106,DAWN,"Piplup, use Whirlpool! "
12,51,107,PIPLUP,[WHIRLPOOL MOVE] 
12,51,108,DAWN,"Pachirisu, Discharge! "
12,51,109,PACHIRISU,[DISCHARGE MOVE] 
12,51,110,"DAWN, PIPLUP, BUNEARY, PACHIRIRU",[AMAZED] 
12,51,111,DAWN,"All right! That worked, too! "
12,51,112,ZOEY,"That was beautiful, Dawn! "
12,51,113,DAWN,Zoey! You were watching me? 
12,51,114,ZOEY,You must be really psyched to be out here doing such intensive training and this late at night. 
12,51,115,DAWN,"Well, see, I know I sounded pretty confident earlier, but I'm worried a little bit. "
12,51,116,ZOEY,Now why? Those combinations of yours will definitely take you far in the Contest! 
12,51,117,DAWN,"Yeah, but at the same time I've never really been in a Double Contest Battle before... "
12,51,118,DAWN,That's why I'm trying so hard to come up with a new Combination that will get me a win for sure! But... 
12,51,119,ZOEY,Why don't we work on this tomorrow? I'll do whatever I can to help! 
12,51,120,DAWN,Wow! You'll help me to train Zoey? 
12,51,121,ZOEY,Sure I will! Sometimes coming up with ideas on the fly is a fantastic way to train! 
12,51,122,DAWN,"Okay! Thanks, Zoey! I promise I'll do my best! "
12,51,123,"ASH, PIKACHU",[YAWNING] 
12,51,124,RHONDA,It's time for Sinnoh Now- The Battling Trainers! And today's talented guest Trainer has just won his eighth Badge! Meet Paul from Veilstone City! 
12,51,125,ASH,It's Paul. 
12,51,126,RHONDA,"Eight Badges means you're qualified to enter the Sinnoh League, right? "
12,51,127,PAUL,Right. And my training will continue- as I have every intention of winning the Sinnoh League! 
12,51,128,ASH,What do you know? So Paul finally won his eighth badge. 
12,51,129,BROCK,You've got some catching up to do! 
12,51,130,ASH,"Yeah, but we'll do it! Right, Pikachu? "
12,51,131,PIKACHU,[CONFIDENT] 
12,51,132,BROCK,"By the way, where's Dawn? "
12,51,133,PIKACHU,[CONCERNED] 
12,51,134,CANDICE,I think I ate a bit too many sweets last night. 
12,51,135,ASH,Hey Candice! Have you seen Dawn around? 
12,51,136,CANDICE,Sure! Dawn's doing a little training with Zoey over on the Battle Field! Her kiai's peaking! 
12,51,137,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
12,51,138,"ASH, BROCK",That so? 
12,51,139,DAWN,"Okay! For my Double Battle, I want to come up with some sort of way to put together Mamoswine's Ice Shard with another Pokémon's move! "
12,51,140,ZOEY,Ice Shard is a powerful move so it's definitely worth working on! 
12,51,141,DAWN,But so far I've been a little short on some good ideas. 
12,51,142,ZOEY,"Okay, then, why not try having Mamoswine use Ice Shard first? Let's see. Those rocks are a good target! "
12,51,143,DAWN,"Okay! Got that, Mamoswine? "
12,51,144,MAMOSWINE,[CONFIRMING] 
12,51,145,DAWN,Use Ice Shard! 
12,51,146,MAMOSWINE,[ICE SHARD MOVE] 
12,51,147,CANDICE,"Wow that was nice, Dawn! Using Ice Shard is a great idea! "
12,51,148,DAWN,Thanks Candice! 
12,51,149,ZOEY,"Now, for the next move. "
12,51,150,ASH,They're both working hard! 
12,51,151,CANDICE,This is how rivals should be! 
12,51,152,BROCK,"With Zoey lending a hand, Dawn should be able to come up with some great ideas! "
12,51,153,ASH,"Candice, shouldn't you get back to the Snowpoint Gym soon? "
12,51,154,CANDICE,"No, it's fine! Besides, I can't leave now when those two are all kiai'd up like this! "
12,51,155,ASH,Right! Yeah of course! 
12,51,156,ZOEY,May I see Mamoswine's and your other Pokémon's Combinations? So I can see how effective they'll be in battle... 
12,51,157,DAWN,Sure! 
12,51,158,MAMOSWINE,[PREPARING] 
12,51,159,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
12,51,160,DAWN,"Piplup, Bubblebeam let's go! "
12,51,161,PIPLUP,[BUBBLEBEAM MOVE] 
12,51,162,DAWN,"All right Mamoswine, use Ice Shard! "
12,51,163,MAMOSWINE,[ICE SHARD MOVE] 
12,51,164,PIPLUP,[STUNNED] 
12,51,165,"ASH, BROCK, CANDICE, ZOEY, PIKACHU",[SHOCKED] 
12,51,166,PIPLUP,[PAINED] 
12,51,167,PIPLUP,[PANICKING] 
12,51,168,ASH,"Pikachu, use Iron Tail! "
12,51,169,PIKACHU,[IRON TAIL MOVE] 
12,51,170,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
12,51,171,JAMES,What's with the early hub-bub? 
12,51,172,JESSIE,Twerpettes...and one of them is sunglasses-topped! 
12,51,173,MEOWTH,Looks like Twerpette training time to me... 
12,51,174,DAWN,"Piplup, are you all right? "
12,51,175,PIPLUP,[UNSURE] 
12,51,176,ZOEY,Freezing your Pokémon's partner is not the best Contest move... 
12,51,177,DAWN,So what do you I do? 
12,51,178,CANDICE,Why not try something like this? 
12,51,179,CANDICE,Abomasnow! 
12,51,180,ABOMASNOW,[APPEARING] 
12,51,181,CANDICE,"Now if you don't mind Dawn and Mamoswine, - watch closely! - "
12,51,182,DAWN,Uh... Ok. 
12,51,183,CANDICE,Abomasnow and I going to show you - a variation on Ice Shard! - 
12,51,184,DAWN,Uh...Okay. 
12,51,185,CANDICE,"Ice Shard, go! "
12,51,186,ABOMASNOW,[ICE SHARD MOVE] 
12,51,187,CANDICE,"Now, Razor Leaf! "
12,51,188,ABOMASNOW,[RAZOR LEAF MOVE] 
12,51,189,"ASH, BROCK, ZOEY, PIKACHU",[AMAZED] 
12,51,190,DAWN,Wow...Amazing! 
12,51,191,CANDICE,See? You won't freeze up your Pokémon's partner that way! 
12,51,192,DAWN,Let me try! 
12,51,193,CANDICE,Sure! Go for it Dawn! 
12,51,194,ABOMASNOW,[REASSURING] 
12,51,195,JESSIE,All hail Gym Leaders! 
12,51,196,MEOWTH,"Be a fan on your own time, capiche? "
12,51,197,JAMES,"Let's make our stylish entrance, steal some Pokémon, then flee! "
12,51,198,JESSIE,Shut your twin yaps and leave me be! No talking in class... 
12,51,199,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
12,51,200,DAWN,"Piplup, it's break time! Ready, Pachirisu? "
12,51,201,DAWN,"Mamoswine, you saw that! The trick is to shatter the Ice Shard with your tusks and then make it swirl around Pachirisu! "
12,51,202,MAMOSWINE,[AGREEING] 
12,51,203,DAWN,"And Pachirisu, you use Discharge when the Ice Shard is surrounding you! "
12,51,204,MAMOSWINE,[ROARING] 
12,51,205,PACHIRISU,[EXCITED] 
12,51,206,DAWN,"Mamoswine, use Ice Shard! "
12,51,207,MAMOSWINE,[ICE SHARD MOVE] 
12,51,208,PACHIRISU,[EXCITED] - 
12,51,209,DAWN,Yes! - 
12,51,210,ZOEY,Fingers crossed... 
12,51,211,DAWN,"Pachirisu, Discharge! "
12,51,212,PACHIRISU,[DISCHARGE MOVE] 
12,51,213,CANDICE,Gorgeous! 
12,51,214,ASH,"Man, Dawn's on a roll now! "
12,51,215,PIKACHU,[AGREEING] 
12,51,216,DAWN,"Quick Pachirisu, smash those rocks! "
12,51,217,PACHIRISU,[SURPRISED] 
12,51,218,BROCK,Now how is that going to work? 
12,51,219,PACHIRISU,[UNSURE] 
12,51,220,BROCK,"It's a good idea, but there's no way it's going to reach those rocks from above! "
12,51,221,PACHIRISU,[CONFUSED] 
12,51,222,DAWN,Oh no! Pachirisu! 
12,51,223,CANDICE,I wouldn't exactly call that a Battle-worthy move. 
12,51,224,DAWN,And I was so sure it would work... 
12,51,225,ZOEY,Don't b*at yourself up! It'll make an awesome move for the Performance Round! 
12,51,226,DAWN,Man! That Double Battle will be here soon and I'm all out of ideas! Maybe I should just quit while I'm ahead. 
12,51,227,ZOEY,Hey don't even go there! I know what! How about having a Double Battle against me? 
12,51,228,DAWN,Even though I don't have a clue about which move to use? 
12,51,229,ZOEY,You haven't tried your other Pokémon... Like your new Pokémon Cyndaquil! 
12,51,230,"PIPLUP, BUNEARY, PACHIRISU",[SURPRISED] 
12,51,231,CYNDAQUIL,[DEMONSTRATING] 
12,51,232,ASH,You don't have to worry about Cyndaquil being up for it! 
12,51,233,DAWN,Yeah... But Fire and Ice-type Pokémon aren't compatible... Aren't compatible? 
12,51,234,CANDICE,Sometimes certain things you'd never think would go together end up going together really well! 
12,51,235,DAWN,"Hold on a minute. Now that I think about it, Zoey's Shellos and Glameow's combination moves aren't compatible with each other either, but they work together perfectly! "
12,51,236,DAWN,"Double Battle sounds great! You'll help me, Zoey? "
12,51,237,ZOEY,Sure! 
12,51,238,ASH,I wonder which Pokémon Zoey's going to use? 
12,51,239,BROCK,"I would think she'd use Glameow for sure, so it's a toss between Shellos and Misdreavus if you ask me... "
12,51,240,CANDICE,We'll see about that. I doubt very much that she's doing this battle just for Dawn! 
12,51,241,CANDICE,Zo Zo's always thinking about the big picture! 
12,51,242,JESSIE,I'm definitely going to stick to this Battle like glue! 
12,51,243,JAMES,What about showing the sunglasses-topped Twerpette what for? 
12,51,244,MEOWTH,You want to start a fan club for her? 
12,51,245,ZOEY,"Leafeon, Kirlia! Ready? Go! "
12,51,246,LEAFEON,[APPEARING] 
12,51,247,KIRLIA,[APPEARING] 
12,51,248,DAWN,You've got a new Pokémon! Wow! 
12,51,249,ASH,Awesome! 
12,51,250,POKEDEX,"Leafeon. The Verdant Pokémon. Leafeon is always surrounded by fresh, clean air because it uses photosynthesis just like a plant. "
12,51,251,POKEDEX,"Kirlia. The Emotion Pokémon. Kirlia is able to sense the feelings of its Trainer, and when it becomes happy, it will start to dance. "
12,51,252,ZOEY,The two of them and I are training really hard! Hopefully they'll have their debut at the Grand Festival... 
12,51,253,CYNDAQUIL,[EXCITED] 
12,51,254,MAMOSWINE,[AGREEING] - 
12,51,255,DAWN,"Now, ready Zoey? - "
12,51,256,ZOEY,Yeah!

12,51,260,CYNDAQUIL,[FLAME WHEEL MOVE] 
12,51,261,CYNDAQUIL,[STUNNED] 
12,51,262,BROCK,The shattered Ice Shard had to have melted from Cyndaquil's heat! 
12,51,263,ASH,Well that's not going to work... 
12,51,264,PIKACHU,[SAD] 
12,51,265,ZOEY,"Don't worry, Dawn! Even if it didn't work, combining Fire and Ice-type moves is a great idea! "
12,51,266,CANDICE,Now's the perfect time to take a moment and try to visualize the move you want to use! 
12,51,267,DAWN,"Visualize the move. It's cold, but it's hot. It's sweet, but it's spicy. Hot and spicy. Sweet ice cream. Cyndaquil! Use Flame Wheel and stay put! "
12,51,268,CYNDAQUIL,[FLAME WHEEL MOVE] 
12,51,269,DAWN,"Okay Mamoswine, after the shattered Ice Shard surrounds Cyndaquil, go ahead and freeze it once again! "
12,51,270,DAWN,"Now, Ice Shard! "
12,51,271,MAMOSWINE,[ICE SHARD MOVE] 
12,51,272,CYNDAQUIL,[EXCITED] 
12,51,273,DAWN,Use Ice Shard one more time! 
12,51,274,MAMOSWINE,[ICE SHARD MOVE] 
12,51,275,CYNDAQUIL,[FLAME WHEEL MOVE] 
12,51,276,DAWN,It worked! And it was that spicy Tamato Berry ice cream bar that inspired me! I'm calling that move Flame Ice! 
12,51,277,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",That's nice! 
12,51,278,BROCK,The ice is sparkling from the rotating flames! 
12,51,279,ASH,"Yeah, what a pretty move! "
12,51,280,PIKACHU,[AMAZED] 
12,51,281,ZOEY,"Dawn, that's amazing! "
12,51,282,DAWN,All right Cyndaquil! att*ck Leafeon and Kirlia now! 
12,51,283,CYNDAQUIL,[FLAME WHEEL MOVE] 
12,51,284,"DAWN, MAMOSWINE",[SHOCKED] 
12,51,285,CANDICE,And it was so close! A little longer and it could've been the finishing move for the Double Battle! 
12,51,286,"LEAFEON, KIRLIA",[DODGING] 
12,51,287,CYNDAQUIL,[SURPRISED]

12,51,299,DAWN,"Mamoswine, are you all right? Cyndaquil! "
12,51,300,CYNDAQUIL,[WOBBLING] 
12,51,301,JAMES,"Hey Jessie, where are you toddling off to? "
12,51,302,JAMES,What's causing your boot heels to be wandering? 
12,51,303,MEOWTH,A day without messing with Twerpettes is like a day without sunshine! 
12,51,304,JESSIE,I wouldn't dream of doing anything to sabotage such talented maidens as they. 
12,51,305,JAMES,Strange. She looks like Jess. 
12,51,306,MEOWTH,Yeah but that's a whole new load of hooey. 
12,51,307,JESSIE,"I'm kidding! But I now know how to win a Double Battle! All I have to do is combine two totally different Pokémon's moves. Yanmega, use Silver Wind! "
12,51,308,YANMEGA,[SILVER WIND MOVE] 
12,51,309,MEOWTH,Yipes! Incoming Fire! 
12,51,310,JESSIE,"Wobbuffet, take the reins. "

12,51,317,ZOEY,Dawn you were great too! - 
12,51,318,DAWN,"Wow, Zoey, thanks! "
12,51,319,CANDICE,That's what true rivals are all about! - Your kiai is strong! - 
12,51,320,DAWN,Thanks! 
12,51,321,ZOEY,"Once you master your Flame Ice, I'm sure it'll be a brilliant Double Battle move! "
12,51,322,DAWN,"Thanks, Zoey! I'm definitely going to master it before the Daybreak Contest! And before you know it, that fifth Contest Ribbon will be all mine! "
12,51,323,"MAMOSWINE, PIPLUP, CYNDAQUIL",[EXCITED] 
12,51,324,ASH,"All right! And Pikachu, let's work real hard and win our eighth Badge, okay? "

12,51,326,NARRATOR,"They say necessity is the mother of invention, and Dawn's brand new move proves it, as she confidently heads into the Daybreak Contest! So, for all of our heroes, the journey continues"
12,50,0,DAWN,"Oh, no... - "
12,50,1,ASH,Man...Bet you we're lost! 
12,50,2,DAWN,How big is this forest anyway?

12,50,10,"ASH, PIKACHU",[SURPRISED] 
12,50,11,ASH,That way!

12,50,38,PIPLUP,"[DAZED] Sometimes it's hard to know, Which way you're supposed to go. But deep inside, you know you're strong. If you follow your heart, you can't be wrong. Stand up! [Stand up!] For what is right. Be brave! Get ready to fight. Hold on! [Hold on!] We're friends for life. And if we come, together as one, Complete the quest, that we've begun, We will win the battle! Galactic Battles! Pokémon! "
12,50,39,PIPLUP,[WEAK] 
12,50,40,DAWN,"Piplup, please tell me you're all right! "
12,50,41,MAYA,Sorry! I never thought people or Pokémon would be way out here like this! 
12,50,42,MAYA,"Chimecho, are you okay? "
12,50,43,CHIMECHO,[CONTENT] 
12,50,44,POKEDEX,"Chimecho. The Wind Chime Pokémon. Its cries, which reverberate in its hollow body, emerge as notes of beauty, which drive off its opponents. "
12,50,45,"PIPLUP, PIKACHU",[SURPRISED] 
12,50,46,MCCANN,I'll be! I'm shocked to find signs of life in this thick forest! 
12,50,47,ASH,Excuse me! Hey is that your Scizor? 
12,50,48,MAYA,Wow. You don't know who this is do you? 
12,50,49,ASH,Guess I don't! 
12,50,50,DAWN,Well I sure know! They did a story on you for Sinnoh Now! 
12,50,51,DAWN,Yeah you're that Air-Battle Master. 
12,50,52,MAYA,McCann! - 
12,50,53,ASH,Air-Battle Master? - 
12,50,54,MAYA,"Right. That's it! See, when it comes to Air Battling my grandfather, McCann is undefeated and unbeatable! "
12,50,55,ASH,Wow! 
12,50,56,MAYA,"But, now that he's retired he lives a quiet life up in the mountains near here. Sometimes he even lets me battle him! "
12,50,57,BROCK,I see. So that's what that Air Battle was all about! 
12,50,58,MCCANN,"Now, the thing is, the way the wind blows around here makes this valley quite unique! It's about as perfect for Air Battles as you're going to get! "
12,50,59,MAYA,"Every so often, someone asks Grandpa to teach them everything he knows! So many seem to want to learn every last one of his secrets. "
12,50,60,MAYA,Just yesterday a student asked to help make his Crobat stronger! 
12,50,61,BROCK,And so did you help him out? 
12,50,62,MCCANN,"Nah, I decided he didn't have a chance! "
12,50,63,MAYA,"Right! See, most people don't have a chance! But even if they can't become students, they bring their Pokémon to be trained, right Grandpa? "
12,50,64,MCCANN,Right dear. 
12,50,65,MAYA,"So, most requests get turned down right from the start! "
12,50,66,MCCANN,I figure if there's no chance for them to become strongit's a waste of my time! 
12,50,67,GLISCOR,[EXCITED] 
12,50,68,ASH,Gliscor! Want to try? 
12,50,69,GLISCOR,[AFFIRMING] 
12,50,70,ASH,"Mr. McCann? Would you consider battling with my Gliscor, please? You see, we're on a journey together to win the Sinnoh League! "
12,50,71,MCCANN,Are you saying your Gliscor is strong? 
12,50,72,ASH,Yeah! Gliscor's a huge help in my Gym Battles! 
12,50,73,GLISCOR,[EXCITED] 
12,50,74,MCCANN,Well! I wonder about that... 
12,50,75,DAWN,It'd be great! Please? 
12,50,76,BROCK,It sure would! 
12,50,77,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
12,50,78,PIPLUP,[CONVINCING] 
12,50,79,MAYA,Why not? Since you're retired there's not that much to do... 
12,50,80,MCCANN,Perhaps...might be a nice way to k*ll some time! 
12,50,81,ASH,"k*ll some time, huh? "
12,50,82,MCCANN,"Scizor, let's go! "
12,50,83,SCIZOR,[APPEARING]

12,50,88,MCCANN,"All right then, shall we begin? - "

12,50,146,ASH,No good! 
12,50,147,DAWN,It seems like... Scizor's come up with some sort of way to dance with the wind! 
12,50,148,JESSIE,Please. You'd think the Twerps were using vanishing cream! 
12,50,149,MEOWTH,"Well, they slathered it on when they hit the forest... "
12,50,150,JAMES,So Twerpishly slick! 
12,50,151,JESSIE,Twerps at five o'clock! And they're ballooning it to boot! 
12,50,152,JAMES,What a hoot! 
12,50,153,JESSIE,What's with the turbo charge? 
12,50,154,JAMES,I don't want up I want down! 
12,50,155,MEOWTH,Don't worry buddy boy you'll get that soon enough! 
12,50,156,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",We're blasting off again! 
12,50,157,MAYA,"Grandpa, shouldn't you wrap this up soon? "
12,50,158,MCCANN,I suppose. No sense wasting any more of my time! 
12,50,159,MCCANN,Scizor! Hyper Beam lets go!

12,50,165,BROCK,Oh no! As soon as Scizor used Hyper Beam it climbedto a safe distance from Gliscor by riding the wind! 
12,50,166,MCCANN,All right! Scizor now do a steep dive and then use Double Hit! 
12,50,167,SCIZOR,[EXERTION]

12,50,173,ASH,Gliscor! Are you okay? 
12,50,174,GLISCOR,[STRUGGLING] 
12,50,175,BROCK,That was rough! 
12,50,176,ASH,Yeah! Poor Gliscor wasn't even able to get in a single hit! 
12,50,177,GLISCOR,[CRYING] 
12,50,178,ASH,"Hey Gliscor, don't cry! "
12,50,179,MAYA,Your Gliscor's quite a weakling! 
12,50,180,MCCANN,Too bad! There are better ways to k*ll some time. - 
12,50,181,MAYA,He's right! - 
12,50,182,MCCANN,"Look kid. If you want your Gliscor to become strong, it's going to take a lot of effort. "
12,50,183,MCCANN,So let me teach you the basics of Air Battling! 
12,50,184,MCCANN,The key to Air Battling is reading the wind! 
12,50,185,ASH,The wind? 
12,50,186,MCCANN,"Right! You need to know what wind is blowing where, where the wind's subsiding, and where the wind's gotten stronger! Where the wind is bending, and which way. That's what is called reading the wind! "
12,50,187,ASH,"Wow! Reading the wind, huh? "
12,50,188,MCCANN,A Pokémon learns to read it with its entire body. 
12,50,189,MCCANN,"But the wind never blows the same way twice! Sunny days, rainy days, each day brings different currents! "
12,50,190,MCCANN,"And since they're always changing, learning how to read them is the secret to winning an Air Battle! "
12,50,191,ASH,"Wow, that's it. "
12,50,192,MCCANN,"Isn't that what makes it interesting, Maya? "
12,50,193,MAYA,"That's right, Grandpa! "
12,50,194,MCCANN,"The sun is going down. We've got a lovely guesthouse, and you're welcome to stay there! "
12,50,195,GLISCOR,[CRYING] 
12,50,196,ASH,"Yeah, that was a tough loss, eh, Gliscor? "

12,50,199,ASH,Gliscor? 
12,50,200,ASH,"Not much of an appetite, huh? "
12,50,201,DAWN,You've got to eat if you want to get stronger!

12,50,206,GLISCOR,[DISAGREEING] 
12,50,207,ASH,"But Gliscor, you've got to get some rest! "
12,50,208,BROCK,I guess Gliscor's got a lot to think about. 
12,50,209,ASH,Guess so.

12,50,229,ASH,Dawn! 
12,50,230,DAWN,I took a bit of tin foil and used it to make confetti. Watch this!

12,50,274,MCCANN,Really? You want an Air Battle with me again? 
12,50,275,MAYA,Even though Gliscor wasn't able to land a single hit before? 
12,50,276,ASH,"Yes we do. We're asking for another chance, please! "
12,50,277,PIKACHU,[PLEADING]

12,50,280,BROCK,They get it now! 
12,50,281,ASH,"Of course, we might not be able to b*at Scizor after all of this, but still, we really want to check just how far we've comeand look at Gliscor's progress! "
12,50,282,GLISCOR,[AGREEING] 
12,50,283,MCCANN,"Dear, what should I do? "

12,50,335,MCCANN,"Scizor, now that Gliscor's used Giga Impact, it won't be able to use another move for awhile! Counter-att*ck, quick! "
12,50,336,SCIZOR,[AGREEING] 
12,50,337,BROCK,"Yes! After Giga Impact, Gliscor used the wind to get super-far away from Scizor! "
12,50,338,DAWN,That's exactly the same combination Scizor used! 
12,50,339,ASH,"Gliscor, way to go! - "
12,50,340,MAYA,Pretty good! - 
12,50,341,MCCANN,"Yes, but play time is all over for now... "

12,50,358,GLISCOR,[AFFIRMING] 
12,50,359,ASH,So we lost again... 
12,50,360,GLISCOR,[SAD] 
12,50,361,ASH,"But not only did you learn how to read the wind, you learned a brand new move too! And that's really good, you know? "
12,50,362,GLISCOR,[AGREEING] 
12,50,363,DAWN,Sure is! It's great! 
12,50,364,BROCK,That's real progress!

12,50,368,MCCANN,Indeed! 
12,50,369,MCCANN,Tell me Ash. How would you like to leave Gliscor with me for a little training? 
12,50,370,ASH,Leave Gliscor here? 
12,50,371,MCCANN,"If your Gliscor was able to learn to read the wind that well in just one night, there's the making of a great pupil there! "
12,50,372,ASH,"Whoa, I don't know what to say. "
12,50,373,MCCANN,It's quite amazing how this reminds me of the very first time I met Scizor! It's been a long time since I've met a Pokémon I wanted to train! 
12,50,374,GLISCOR,[CONSIDERING] 
12,50,375,GLISCOR,[CRYING] 
12,50,376,ASH,Gliscor... 
12,50,377,GLISCOR,[CURIOUS] 
12,50,378,ASH,"So, do you want to come with us... or do you want to stay here with McCann and train? "
12,50,379,ASH,It's totally up to you! 
12,50,380,PIKACHU,[AGREEING] 
12,50,381,PIPLUP,[AGREEING] 
12,50,382,GLISCOR,[QUESTIONING] 
12,50,383,MCCANN,It looks to me like Gliscor would like to stay here and train with me! 
12,50,384,GLISCOR,[AGREEING] - 
12,50,385,ASH,Got it... - 
12,50,386,BROCK,Ash... 
12,50,387,ASH,Yeah! 
12,50,388,ASH,"It's fine! If that's what you decided, that's that! "
12,50,389,GLISCOR,[HAPPY] 
12,50,390,BROCK,Well what do you know. Gliscor's going to stay here and train with Mr. McCann... 
12,50,391,DAWN,"Wow, Gliscor's grown a lot! "
12,50,392,MCCANN,The truth is both Trainer and Pokémon have the desire to become as strong as they can! 
12,50,393,ASH,"Mr. McCann, please take good care of my Gliscor! "
12,50,394,MCCANN,Thanks. 
12,50,395,MAYA,You just leave it all up to my Grandpa! He'll do a great job training Gliscor! 
12,50,396,JESSIE,The thought of crashing the party crossed my mind... 
12,50,397,JAMES,But even criminals the likes of Team Rocket wouldn't intrude on a touching scene such as this one! 
12,50,398,MEOWTH,Mooshy but true. 
12,50,399,JESSIE,"Besides, it would be prudent to wait, at least until Gliscor gets big and strong before we go for the grab. "
12,50,400,JAMES,"Sporting. Good luck, chum! "
12,50,401,DAWN,"Good luck with all your training, Gliscor! "
12,50,402,BROCK,And be well!

12,50,408,MAYA,Yeah take care!

12,49,2,NARRATOR,"With his final Sinnoh League Gym badge hanging in the balance, we find Ash in training with Dawn's able assistance. "

12,49,10,DAWN,What's going on? 
12,49,11,ASH,Wow! A treasure chest! Cool! 
12,49,12,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
12,49,13,BROCK,Yeah and it's really well made!

12,49,17,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] - 
12,49,18,BROCK,"Whoa, it's stuck tight! - "
12,49,19,ASH,Here. Let me try it! 
12,49,20,JESSIE,I love Twerps who struggle! 
12,49,21,JAMES,I'll wager that treasure chest is chock-full of goodies by the gob! 
12,49,22,MEOWTH,Those goody six shoes don't deserve goodies no way! Grabbing the goods is what I say! 
12,49,23,"JESSIE, JAMES","Yay! Sometimes it's hard to know, Which way you're supposed to go. But deep inside, you know you're strong. If you follow your heart, you can't be wrong. Stand up! [Stand up!] For what is right. Be brave! Get ready to fight. Hold on! [Hold on!] We're friends for life. And if we come, together as one, Complete the quest, that we've begun, We will win the battle! Galactic Battles! Pokémon! "
12,49,24,ASH,What do we do with it? 
12,49,25,BROCK,Well...maybe we should bring it over to Officer Jenny for a look! 
12,49,26,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH","Ah, chest fever! "
12,49,27,MEOWTH,Treasure chests are our middle name! 
12,49,28,JAMES,We're the Treasure Chest g*ng! And we've never met a chest that didn't cheerfully ring our chesty chimes! 
12,49,29,JESSIE,"And right now, trust us with your treasure chest, and we'll have it safely in the arms of Officer Jenny in a jiff! "
12,49,30,ASH,Hold on a second! 
12,49,31,JESSIE,"You trust us, or else! "
12,49,32,ASH,"All right, who are you guys? "
12,49,33,JESSIE,"The truth? I'd tell you, but your head would explode! "
12,49,34,JAMES,Though it's tons of fun reciting this ode! 
12,49,35,MEOWTH,Enough secret code! 
12,49,36,ASH,"Oh boy, you guys! "
12,49,37,JESSIE,"Toss the treasure, Twerp! "
12,49,38,ASH,"Okay Pikachu, time to use Thunderbolt. "

12,49,40,"JAMES, JESSIE, MEOWTH",We're blasting off right off the bat! 
12,49,41,JAMES,"When I take a tumble, my head is a jumble! Wait! - I remember now! - "
12,49,42,MEOWTH,Spill it! 
12,49,43,JAMES,It's about that treasure chest! I buried it here when I was but a little shaver! 
12,49,44,JESSIE,"So by law, that chest is yours! "
12,49,45,JAMES,Ergo! 
12,49,46,MEOWTH,"Hey, what kind of stash is in there? "
12,49,47,JAMES,Well pish! My poor memory's on the fritz! Let's see perhaps some rarified bottle cap booty? Or maybe some kiddy's toys. 
12,49,48,JESSIE,So? Big noise! 
12,49,49,MEOWTH,It sounds to me like a treasure tailor-made for a Twerp! 
12,49,50,JAMES,"Although, it might contain an allowance or two. "
12,49,51,JESSIE,That's big bucks with you! 
12,49,52,MEOWTH,So let's do what we have to do! 
12,49,53,ASH,"Man, what's in here? I really shouldn't care, but it's kind of eating at me, you know? "
12,49,54,DAWN,Me too! 
12,49,55,ASH,"All right, what do you guys want? "
12,49,56,JAMES,That treasure chest is mine! I remember burying it out here back in my youth! 
12,49,57,DAWN,You think we're going to believe that nonsense? 
12,49,58,ASH,Yeah! Like we're going to fall for that dumb lie! 
12,49,59,JAMES,It's the dumb truth! You've got to believe me. 
12,49,60,BROCK,"All right, if this treasure chest is yours, you should be able to open it! "
12,49,61,ASH,"Yeah Brock's right! Open it, and we'll believe you! "
12,49,62,JAMES,I accept your challenge! 
12,49,63,MEOWTH,He sounds like he knows what he's doing! 
12,49,64,JESSIE,About time! For a change of pace. 
12,49,65,JAMES,Open up! 
12,49,66,MEOWTH,Me and my big mouth. 
12,49,67,JESSIE,Back to the real world... 
12,49,68,JAMES,"That's it! Password! I believe it's the word open followed by the name of a Pokémon... Okay, open Growlithe!' "
12,49,69,JAMES,"Open, Growlie now! Open, Growlie Growlithe! "
12,49,70,JAMES,Could it be? 
12,49,71,JAMES,"Oops, my mistake! The security system activates when you get it wrong three times! Run! "
12,49,72,"JAMES, JESSIE, MEOWTH",Two blasts offs are two too many! 
12,49,73,JAMES,Annoying. Ha! I just remembered! 
12,49,74,JESSIE,Your memories are giving me a headache! 
12,49,75,MEOWTH,"So, what's the password pal? "
12,49,76,JAMES,Beats me! I remembered what's inside though. 
12,49,77,JESSIE,That would be... 
12,49,78,MEOWTH,Your allowance dough? 
12,49,79,JAMES,"No, no, not that. It's something that mustn't be allowed to be shown in this world at all costs! "
12,49,80,JAMES,I'll make my world safe once more. If it's the last thing I do! 
12,49,81,ASH,Check it out! 
12,49,82,PIKACHU,[AMAZED] 
12,49,83,DAWN,I'd love to know what kind of people live there! 
12,49,84,"ASH, DAWN, BROCK, PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[SHOCKED] 
12,49,85,SEBASTIAN,I can't believe my eyes! It's Master James' treasure chest! 
12,49,86,SEBASTIAN,It's his all right. You see? It's a drawing of Growlie Master James etched! 
12,49,87,DAWN,Growlie? 
12,49,88,ASH,I think I've heard that name before. 
12,49,89,BROCK,Of course! Because it's the nickname James gave his Pokémon when he was young! 
12,49,90,SEBASTIAN,It's young Master James... And if this treasure chest has returned that means Master James has returned as well! Where is he? Where is he? Young Master James! Master James! Master James? 
12,49,91,DAWN,"Guys, is the young Master James he's talking about the same James from Team Rocket? "
12,49,92,ASH,Uh huh! 
12,49,93,BROCK,This looks a lot to me like one of - James' summer estates. - 
12,49,94,DAWN,Summer estates? 
12,49,95,ASH,"Oh yeah I guess you don't know, right? "
12,49,96,BROCK,"See, James' family is about as rich as they come! "
12,49,97,PIPLUP,[SURPRISED] 
12,49,98,SEBASTIAN,"Now, what have you done with Master James? "
12,49,99,JAMES,"Disaster! If Sebastian should find me, he'll then call mummy and daddy not to mention Jessebelle to boot! - "
12,49,100,JESSIE,Jessebelle? - 
12,49,101,MEOWTH,Who's the girl? 
12,49,102,JAMES,How could you forget? She's none other than that despicable fiancé of mine! 
12,49,103,JESSIE,Oh yeah... A peach! 
12,49,104,JAMES,"Well, if she shows up I'm toast! She'll take me back against my fervent wishes and force me to marry her! "
12,49,105,JESSIE,"Sorry, but it's not my problem. "

12,49,113,DAWN,"Young Master James, huh? I don't understand is what a guy like him is doing in Team Rocket in the first place! "
12,49,114,BROCK,"If I had to guess, maybe he joined Team Rocket looking for freedom! "

12,49,135,BROCK,I remember! I'm pretty sure that she - was going to marry James! - 
12,49,136,DAWN,Going to marry James? Then that means Jessebelle is James' fiancé!

12,49,190,JAMES [KID],Jessebelle. Sweet. 
12,49,191,JAMES,She was my first love. And so I wrote my feelings for her in a letter! 
12,49,192,JAMES [KID],"Jessebelle, darling dearest. Won't you-marry me? That's all he wrote! How embarrassing it would be if someone read this before she... - "

12,49,197,DADDY,"Why, it's a special treasure chest I made myself! For you to put a treasure in though you'll need to use your password first! Then the chest will protect your treasure from harm! "
12,49,198,JAMES [KID],What kind of treasure? 
12,49,199,MUMMY,"Well, like a love letter, for example... "
12,49,200,JAMES [KID],"Ooh! Thank you so much, dear mummy, daddy! "
12,49,201,MUMMY,"And, I just received word from Jessebelle's parents that you've been invited to her house tonight. Isn't that nice? "
12,49,202,JAMES [KID],"Wow, to Jessebelle's house? "
12,49,203,DADDY,Courage! Have courage and tell her how you feel! 
12,49,204,JAMES [KID],Right!

12,49,206,JAMES [KID],Uh Jessebelle there's something I'd like to give you ... 
12,49,207,JESSEBELLE [KID],I've made my decision. And the answer is yes.

12,49,211,JESSEBELLE [KID],"I'll handle all of the arrangements for the ceremony! And I'll instruct you personally on how to act like a true gentleman. Oh, and also, about your Growlithe I expect you get to get rid of it and get a Skitty instead. "
12,49,212,JAMES [KID],A Skitty instead? 
12,49,213,JESSEBELLE [KID],Of course! I don't like Growlithe! 
12,49,214,JAMES [KID],"I won't! My precious Growlie is my partner, and that's that! "
12,49,215,JESSEBELLE [KID],"No, I'm your partner now! "
12,49,216,JAMES [KID] ,"I refuse to get rid of Growlie! So, you can just call off our wedding! "
12,49,217,JAMES [KID],"I had no idea how selfish Jessebelle was! Oh dear. The note... Uh, what's the password? I'll get rid of the whole lot! Growlie, quick! Use Dig! "

12,47,108,ASH,"Professor, wait! We have to do something to help them out! "

12,47,169,JAMES,You're the boss of boxed lunches! 
12,47,170,LOOKER,Whatever. Meanwhile Team Galactic's on a Mt. Coronet watch! It's even possible they might have already spotted us here.

12,47,179,ROWAN,I've presently asked Officer Jenny to check on the status of the entire area. 
12,47,180,DAWN,Do you have any idea where Team Galactic might've gone Professor? 
12,47,181,ROWAN,"No, but I'll be sure pass along any information as it becomes available! "

12,47,185,CYNTHIA,Do you remember the mural in the Celestic Ruins? 
12,47,186,"ASH, DAWN, BROCK",Yeah! 
12,47,187,CYNTHIA,"As of this moment, Team Galactic has the Lake Trio and the two treasures in its possession. Which looks to me like they're fully prepared to call forth Dialga and Palkia. "
12,47,188,CYNTHIA,"Of course Dialga is known as the Ruler of Time, and Palkia is known as the Ruler of Space. But for two Legendary Pokémon like them... "
12,47,189,CYNTHIA,...to fall under human control is beyond comprehension! 
12,47,190,CYNTHIA,"Why, Team Galactic might even be able to unleash ancient powers that we're not even aware of at this point! "
12,47,191,CYRUS,"Now, begin! "

12,47,228,BROCK,That must mean... you're part of Team Galactic! 
12,47,229,JAMES,Dear me. My innate fashion-sensing instincts are telling me Team Galactic must be on the premises! 
12,47,230,JESSIE,Look at the size of that security detail! No doubt with a state-of-the-art hide out! 
12,47,231,MEOWTH,Let's hit them where they hide! 
12,47,232,LOOKER,Slow it down. We need to secure the area first.

12,47,239,SATURN,Sir! 
12,47,240,"JUPITER, CYRUS","But since these children pose a very real thr*at to our plan for a new world order, isn't it only natural to eliminate them? "
12,47,241,CYRUS,"Behold! This is just the kind of accomplishment the human heart has the potential to achieve. But when your heart is ruled by emotions, you will but fight. "
12,47,242,CYRUS,In which case humanity will never advance! 
12,47,243,CYRUS,I guess I could let you know what this is about. 
12,47,244,CYRUS,I am part of this! Team Galactic is my creation. And you are now in my creation's headquarters! 
12,47,245,ASH,Headquarters? In here? 
12,47,246,CYRUS,Correct. We're bringing about the dawn of a new world order! So we're gathered here to discard the old world of discord and conflict and make a much better one in place of it! 
12,47,247,ASH,"So, it was you who stole the Lustrous Orb from the Celestic Ruins! You lied to all of us, and you lied to Cynthia too! It only destroys! - "
12,47,248,CYRUS,Lose your rage. - 
12,47,249,DAWN,No way! Not when you treat Pokémon that way! This has got to stop! Now let them go back to their lake! 
12,47,250,CYRUS,That can't be done. They're quite necessary for us to be able to bring forth the new world! 
12,47,251,BROCK,Then that means it's exactly as Cynthia said it was! 
12,47,252,CYRUS,"Obviously these children must mean something important if the Legendary Pokémon saw fit to bring them all here. We will need to keep them around until our task is completed, - just in case. - "

12,46,52,BROCK,"Based on what you've been describing, I'm attempting to pinpoint the building's exact location. "
12,46,53,BROCK,Is this what you saw? 
12,46,54,ASH,[CURIOUS] 
12,46,55,BROCK,This is Fuego Ironworks. Apparently it's been abandoned for quite some time. 
12,46,56,MEOWTH,We figured we'd sneak onto their turf and have a look-see. 
12,46,57,MEOWTH,But soon as we got inside. 
12,46,58,MEOWTH,The International Police dude from the train station with the lunch boxes was in a heap of trouble! - 
12,46,59,DAWN,International Police? - 
12,46,60,ASH,So the boxed lunch guy. - 
12,46,61,BROCK,That was Looker! -

12,46,63,MEOWTH,"We've got to save the lunch box guy, dig? "
12,46,64,JAMES,A member of the International Police? Please. 
12,46,65,JESSIE,"By law, Team Rocket doesn't save the law. "
12,46,66,MEOWTH,But doing the right thing for a change might help us put Team Galactic on the fashion garbage heap where those freaks belong! 
12,46,67,JAMES,We'd be putting the International Police to work for us. 
12,46,68,JESSIE,Using the good guys to accomplish our evil deeds surely works for me! 
12,46,69,MEOWTH,"First Team Galactic goes down, then Team Rocket goes to town! "
12,46,70,JESSIE,"[SINGING] Team Rocket's gonna grow and thrive, those fashion freaks will take a dive, no jive! "

12,46,84,MEOWTH,They got their filthy mitts on Jessie and James. 
12,46,85,MEOWTH,But the expl*si*n sent me into a solo blastoff.

12,46,102,DAWN,Think of it like this! We're helping Looker for us! 
12,46,103,MEOWTH,You're what? 
12,46,104,BROCK,"Yeah, Looker really helped us out, and now it's our turn to help him out! "
12,46,105,ASH,"Right! So c'mon! Hurry it up and lead us to their base, okay, Meowth? "
12,46,106,PIKACHU,[ENTHUSIASTIC] 
12,46,107,MEOWTH,"Man, those Twerps. "
12,46,108,JESSIE,Excuse me! Anybody home? 
12,46,109,JESSIE,That is one gross Pokémon. 
12,46,110,JESSIE,Enough with the attitude! I'm going to pluck the fur off of your annoying self strand by stupid strand! 
12,46,111,LOOKER,Don't touch! 
12,46,112,SKUNTANK,[AMUSED] 
12,46,113,JESSIE,"Hi, Mommy, I'm home. "
12,46,114,LOOKER,"There are booby traps everywhere. And since electronic devices won't work, we can't use our Poké Balls. Be careful. "
12,46,115,JAMES,"Well, I'll be dipped! "
12,46,116,JESSIE,Just great! Now you tell us! 
12,46,117,LOOKER,I shouldn't have involved you. I'm sorry. 
12,46,118,JAMES,"We involved ourselves, don't you see? Our disdain for Team Galactic brought us here. "
12,46,119,JESSIE,We'll pound those fashion freaks into a fashion pulp! 
12,46,120,JAMES,"And since we did manage to barge into their base, all that remains is to defeat their boss. "
12,46,121,LOOKER,Their boss is not here! 
12,46,122,JAMES,"If this isn't headquarters, what is it? "
12,46,123,LOOKER,It appears to be their secret factory. 
12,46,124,JESSIE,A factory for secrets? 
12,46,125,LOOKER,"Let me explain. At one point in time, this factory was the largest and most successful manufacturer in the entire Sinnoh region. "
12,46,126,LOOKER,"It was closed down due to excessive pollution, but now Team Galactic has been using it as their secret factory if you will. "
12,46,127,LOOKER,Secret in the sense that they're using it tomake.something. 
12,46,128,JUPITER,"Ah, to look upon the exquisite beauty of the Red Chain. It's quite remarkable we could recreate it from the Veilstone City meteorite! "
12,46,129,CHARON,"Not recreate it, resurrect it! And don't forget that the brilliant genius who should be credited with bringing it back into our world is yours truly, known to you as the humble Charon! "
12,46,130,JUPITER,I hate that laugh! 
12,46,131,JUPITER,What are your plans for the International Policeman? 
12,46,132,CHARON,Cyrus has already informed me that he has his own special plans for him. 
12,46,133,SATURN,"Toxicroak, use Rock Smash! "
12,46,134,TOXICROAK,[ROCK SMASH MOVE] 
12,46,135,SATURN,Master Cyrus! We've found it. This is truly the gateway to Spear Pillar! 
12,46,136,CYRUS,"Yes, very well. Block off the area. "
12,46,137,SATURN,"Yes, sir! "
12,46,138,CYRUS,We will not proceed there until all preparations have been made. 
12,46,139,JUPITER,So our searching is finally over. 
12,46,140,CHARON,We've found the gateway to Spear Pillar! 
12,46,141,JUPITER,But the real journey begins now! 
12,46,142,GALACTIC GRUNT,"Jupiter, a flying object has been detected - inside the perimeter! - "
12,46,143,JUPITER,Flying object? 
12,46,144,MEOWTH,"Dig it, guys, up ahead! "
12,46,145,MEOWTH,[SURPRISED] - 
12,46,146,BROCK,Golbat! -

12,46,168,PIPLUP,[SURPRISED] 
12,46,169,PIPLUP,[NERVOUS] 
12,46,170,ASH,Get out of the way! 
12,46,171,JUPITER,You all seem so good at popping up out of nowhere. Want to join Team Galactic? 
12,46,172,DAWN,That would be so.ew! 
12,46,173,MEOWTH,What did you do with Jessie and James? 
12,46,174,ASH,And what about Looker? 
12,46,175,JUPITER,"Oh, Mesprit. "
12,46,176,DAWN,Huh? 
12,46,177,JUPITER,Azelf. 
12,46,178,JUPITER,Uxie. 
12,46,179,JUPITER,Why did it have to be you? 
12,46,180,JUPITER,"I'm talking about the lake trio, of course. Why is it that they chose you? "
12,46,181,ASH,"What do you mean, chose us? "
12,46,182,DAWN,And what's the lake trio? 
12,46,183,JUPITER,You saw them! The Legendary Pokémon spirits that they say reside in those lakes! 
12,46,184,BROCK,"All right, how did you know about that? "
12,46,185,MEOWTH,One of you Twerps wanna clue me in here? I'm kind of flying blind. 
12,46,186,JUPITER,"We know everything about all of it! The truth of the matter is, we were the ones who were supposed to have synchronized with the lake trio! "
12,46,187,GOLBAT GROUP,[ATTACKING]

12,46,193,SKUNTANK,[FLAMETHROWER MOVE]

12,46,207,BROCK,"Hey, wait! "
12,46,208,ASH,[SHOCKED] 
12,46,209,MEOWTH,That flake flew the coop! 
12,46,210,BROCK,"The Golbat are gone, too! "
12,46,211,ASH,"Pikachu and Staraptor, wait a minute! We've got to check around for Team Rocket and Looker first! "
12,46,212,ASH,[EXERTION] 
12,46,213,ASH,Looker! 
12,46,214,BROCK,Where are you? 
12,46,215,MEOWTH,Jessie! James! Report! 
12,46,216,JUPITER,I don't get it. Why did the lake trio choose them in the first place? 
12,46,217,CHARON,"Jealous of those children, are we? "
12,46,218,JUPITER,Jealous? Don't be silly. It's not my style. 
12,46,219,CHARON,"Jealousy is a human emotion, you know. "
12,46,220,JUPITER,Is the Red Chain safe or not? 
12,46,221,CHARON,Don't worry. It's located right below your feet! 
12,46,222,LOOKER,It's gotten awfully quiet out there. 
12,46,223,JESSIE,My stomach's making tons of noise. 
12,46,224,JAMES,Starvation simply stinks! 
12,46,225,LOOKER,Someone's coming! 
12,46,226,LOOKER,It's Ash! - 
12,46,227,DAWN,It's Looker! - 
12,46,228,BROCK,Are you okay? 
12,46,229,MEOWTH,"All right, do you know where my peeps are? "
12,46,230,LOOKER,"Yes, they're both right here with me. "
12,46,231,JESSIE,Meowth! Dear! 
12,46,232,JESSIE,We should've used a sticky note. 
12,46,233,LOOKER,"All right, Ash and Dawn, have Pikachu and Piplup launch an att*ck together so we can break down this door! "
12,46,234,ASH,"You got it! Pikachu, Thunderbolt! "
12,46,235,DAWN,"And Piplup, use Bubble Beam! "
12,46,236,PIKACHU,[ATTACKING] 
12,46,237,LOOKER,You helped me out of a tough spot. Thank you both! 
12,46,238,ASH,No prob! 
12,46,239,MEOWTH,It's so good to see you mugs! - 
12,46,240,JESSIE,I had faith in you! - 
12,46,241,JAMES,Meowth for the clinch! 
12,46,242,JESSIE,What's with the fashion freaks? 
12,46,243,MEOWTH,Team Galactic took a powder to parts unknown. 
12,46,244,JESSIE,Not for long! 
12,46,245,JAMES,"Hasta la vista! Ta, Twerps! "
12,46,246,MEOWTH,"I owe you one, big-time! "
12,46,247,JESSIE,It's been sublime! 
12,46,248,LOOKER,[CONFUSED] 
12,46,249,LOOKER,So Team Galactic escaped again. 
12,46,250,LOOKER,And that means my work here is finished. 
12,46,251,LOOKER,I'd sure like to know what they were working on here. 
12,46,252,DAWN,[CURIOUS] 
12,46,253,DAWN,What's all this? 
12,46,254,LOOKER,"This wasn't part of the Fuego Ironworks, that's for sure. It must be Team Galactic's doing. "
12,46,255,ASH,"Check it out! Looker, what do you think that is? "
12,46,256,PIKACHU,[CURIOUS] 
12,46,257,JESSIE,"Sometimes your sense of direction leaves much to be desired, you know. "
12,46,258,MEOWTH,"It's this way, no doubt! Team Galactic's got nowhere to hide! "
12,46,259,JAMES,"Well, staying the course will get us to Mt. Coronet! "
12,46,260,JESSIE,"We know those fashion freaks have a fondness for frolicking in the mountains, so it's toward the - mountains we will go! - "
12,46,261,JAMES,Coronet ho! 
12,46,262,MEOWTH,Yo yo yo! 
12,46,263,TECHNICIAN,That's it. We're ready! 
12,46,264,OFFICER JENNY,Now we're able to transmit any data from the object directly to headquarters! 
12,46,265,LOOKER,Thanks for all your hard work! 
12,46,266,TECHNICIAN,So let's begin the analysis. 
12,46,267,LOOKER,No! Turn it off! 
12,46,268,DAWN,[PAINED] 
12,46,269,OFFICER JENNY,What could've happened? 
12,46,270,OFFICER JENNY,This is the Floaroma Police. 
12,46,271,DETECTIVE,The data you transmitted to International Police Headquarters has wiped our entire database out! 
12,46,272,LOOKER,And Team Galactic's data? 
12,46,273,DETECTIVE,Apparently it's been destroyed as well. Retrieval uncertain. 
12,46,274,LOOKER,So it was all a trap! 
12,46,275,OFFICER JENNY,So that has to be why they left that red object behind. 
12,46,276,LOOKER,"A warning to stop further investigation, or else! "
12,46,277,ASH,"Whoa, Looker. "
12,46,278,LOOKER,"I'll never give up! The next time Team Galactic is up to something, I'll be there to stop them! "
12,46,279,DAWN,About the lake Pokémon. 
12,46,280,DAWN,What does it all mean? 
12,46,281,ASH,"Not sure, since all we did was see them. "
12,46,282,BROCK,I can't stop wondering how Team Galactic knew all about it! 
12,46,283,PIKACHU,[WORRIED] 
12,46,284,CYRUS,The creation of a new world begins. 
12,46,285,CYRUS,The Spear Key and Spear Pillar. the Adamant Orb and the Lustrous Orb. The Red Chain. Now all that remains are the three lake Pokémon! 
12,46,286,SATURN,All preparations for the Galactic b*mb are complete. 
12,46,287,CYRUS,Excellent. 
12,46,288,CYRUS,"Sorry to keep you waiting, Pokémon Hunter J. "
12,46,289,CYRUS,Please proceed with the lake Pokémon capture as planned. 
12,46,290,NARRATOR,"And so, as Team Galactic's evil intentions begin to reveal themselves. while all of Sinnoh is to be shaken to its very core. "
12,46,291,NARRATOR,"What of Ash, Dawn, and Brock? What does the future hold for our heroes? Stay tuned"
12,45,0,NARRATOR,"As our heroes make their way to the Sunyshore City Gym, "
12,45,1,NARRATOR,a rather impressive town captures their fancy. 
12,45,2,DAWN,"Wow, what a town. It's big! "
12,45,3,PIPLUP,[IMPRESSED] 
12,45,4,BROCK,"First off, why don't we head to the Pokémon Center? "
12,45,5,ASH,Yeah! Great idea. 
12,45,6,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
12,45,7,ASH,Hello there! 
12,45,8,JOY,"Why, hello there! "
12,45,9,BROCK,Hi! It's such a treat to view none other than Nurse Joy! 
12,45,10,BROCK,The viewer's name being Brock! Although my journey here was long and fraught with hardship... 
12,45,11,BROCK,Rain will not defeat me! And wind will not defeat me! 
12,45,12,BROCK,"But though the wind and rain fought to keep me from you, they're powerless against my love for you. Fate has grabbed me and made my dreams come true! "
12,45,13,BROCK,Though Croagunk knows how to grab too! 
12,45,14,CROAGUNK,[CROAKING] 
12,45,15,ASH,"Okay buddy, how about a little training after we get settled in? "

12,45,25,PIKACHU,[APOLOGETIC]

12,45,36,BROCK,"This is strange, even for those two! "
12,45,37,PROFESSOR KODAMA,A puzzlement. This can't be happening. What's going on here? 
12,45,38,JESSIE,"Notch it down, Professor Kodama. We're trying to clean up! "
12,45,39,JAMES,Which is made that much more difficult with you flinging documents! 
12,45,40,MEOWTH,"The circular nature of this gig's a real drag. And with Professor Slobbo, it never ends. "
12,45,41,KODAMA,Blast it! It's simply not scientifically possible for this not to have worked! 
12,45,42,JESSIE,I think the only things he hears come out of his own mouth. 
12,45,43,KODAMA,"Hey! You may call yourselves Team Rocket, but allI see are three good-for-nothing bums without a job until I hired you out of the goodness of my heart! Complain all you want, but you won't get paid for it! "
12,45,44,JAMES,"Though he can hear the grass grow, I do wish he'd turn a deaf ear on our quips. "
12,45,45,JESSIE,Now hear this! I'm sick of cleaning! 
12,45,46,JAMES,I just remembered I've got grocery shopping to do. 
12,45,47,MEOWTH,And I'll go with you! 
12,45,48,JESSIE,Hey! Come back! You can't leave me with Mr. Mess! 
12,45,49,KODAMA,"Excuse me, Jessie. Do me a favor, and organize those papers over there. "

12,45,58,PIPLUP,[LOVESTRUCK] 
12,45,59,PIKACHU,[AFFECTIONATE] 
12,45,60,ASH,"We could try and pull them apart. So Dawn, why don't you grab a hold of Piplup, okay? - "
12,45,61,DAWN,Right! Got it. - 
12,45,62,ASH,Here we go! 
12,45,63,DAWN,And pull!

12,45,74,PIPLUP,[AFFECTIONATE] 
12,45,75,BROCK,No use. 
12,45,76,ASH,"This sure is a big problem, no matter what's going on. "
12,45,77,DAWN,"No duh. What's gotten into them, anyway? "
12,45,78,BROCK,"Hey, I think I've got an idea! Dawn, why don't you try putting Piplup back in its Poké Ball? "
12,45,79,DAWN,"That's a great idea! That'll force those two apart! All right, Piplup, return! "
12,45,80,PIPLUP,[LOVESTRUCK] 
12,45,81,DAWN,"Wow, that worked just like a charm! "
12,45,82,ASH,"Sure did! What the... Pikachu, what's wrong? Say something! "
12,45,83,PIPLUP,[APPEARING] 
12,45,84,DAWN,Piplup?

12,45,86,PIKACHU,[LOVESTRUCK] 
12,45,87,PIPLUP,[LOVESTRUCK] 
12,45,88,PIPLUP,[AFFECTIONATE] - 
12,45,89,ASH,Here we go again. - 
12,45,90,DAWN,Oh no! 
12,45,91,BROCK,That didn't work. Looks like it's back to the old drawing board. 
12,45,92,PIPLUP,[AFFECTIONATE] 
12,45,93,ASH,"Really, Brock? You think this is a good idea? "
12,45,94,BROCK,"Of course! When they first grabbed onto each other, even if we pulled them apart for a moment, as soon as we'd let go, they'd go rushing back to one another. Like they had absolutely no control over what they were doing! And then we'd pull them apart again. And then they'd go rushing back again, as if they were behaving exactly like two magnets. "
12,45,95,BROCK,"So like magnets, if we turn one of them around, they might pop apart. "
12,45,96,DAWN,"I dunno, Brock. "
12,45,97,ASH,"Well, it can't hurt to give it a try! - C'mon, let's do it, Dawn! - "
12,45,98,DAWN,Right with you! 
12,45,99,ASH,And pull.

12,45,107,BROCK,Perfect! - 
12,45,108,ASH,We did it! 
12,45,109,DAWN,Wow who would've thought? 
12,45,110,PIKACHU,[AFFECTIONATE] 
12,45,111,ASH,"Oh, man. We gave it our best sh*t. "
12,45,112,DAWN,And after all of that work. It looked so good at first. 
12,45,113,BROCK,Yeah. I was totally convinced that turning them around would do the trick. 
12,45,114,ASH,Now what do we do? 
12,45,115,DAWN,It'd better be good. 
12,45,116,PIKACHU,[AFFECTIONATE] 
12,45,117,ASH,I think we'd better go and talk to Nurse Joy. I'm sure she'll help us figure out what to do! 
12,45,118,DAWN,"Yeah, if anyone can help, she can! "
12,45,119,PIKACHU,[AFFECTIONATE] 
12,45,120,JAMES,Me thinks Twerps have invaded the forest. 
12,45,121,MEOWTH,"Me, too. Did you get a load of the action down there? "
12,45,122,JAMES,No. Just seemed Twerpish. 
12,45,123,MEOWTH,"Well, this sharp-clawed detective saw something interesting a-percolating. "
12,45,124,JAMES,Care to elucidate? 
12,45,125,MEOWTH,Not now. Let's zip it for the moment and go keep an eye on the Twerps' every move! 
12,45,126,JAMES,I want to know what's interesting! 
12,45,127,ASH,Check it out! 
12,45,128,ASH,A Squirtle and a Raichu! 
12,45,129,SQUIRTLE,[AFFECTIONATE] 
12,45,130,DAWN,And look! A Marill and a Luxio! 
12,45,131,BROCK,And there's a Mareep and an Octillery! 
12,45,132,ASH,What's this? Nurse Joy? 
12,45,133,DAWN,My Piplup and his Pikachu are stuck together just the same way! 
12,45,134,JOY,"You guys, too? Their Pokémon as well. "
12,45,135,CHILD A,"I brought it out of its Poké Ball for a battle when all of a sudden, this stuff! "
12,45,136,CHILD B,"They're stuck together tight, and they won't separate! "
12,45,137,CHILD C,"And when I try to get it to return, it just pops out again! I don't know what to do. "
12,45,138,CHILDREN [X],"Nurse Joy, please do something! "
12,45,139,JOY,"Well, I'll try! I hope. "
12,45,140,BROCK,Hold on. No way! 
12,45,141,ASH,What's up? 
12,45,142,BROCK,There's Pikachu and Piplup... there's Squirtle and Raichu... then Marill and Luxio... and Mareep and Octillery! Each pair is a Water type and an Electric type. 
12,45,143,DAWN,"Wow, come to think of it, you're totally right. "
12,45,144,BROCK,"Nurse Joy, what other types of Pokémon do you have here in the center? "
12,45,145,JOY,Just what you'd expect. But these are the only ones who are stuck together! 
12,45,146,BROCK,Electric types and Water types only. What in the world could it mean? 
12,45,147,MEOWTH,"I don't know, though it could mean the professor's experiment's finally working perfectly! "
12,45,148,MEOWTH,"This could be a groove, or it could be a zero. Either way, let's book back to the lab and see what's up! "
12,45,149,JAMES,Okay...I think... 
12,45,150,JESSIE,"If you don't say something to Grouch Puss, I will! "
12,45,151,JAMES,Shh! Let's leave the fact-finding to Meowth. - 
12,45,152,MEOWTH,Professor Kodama? - 
12,45,153,KODAMA,What is it? 
12,45,154,MEOWTH,"See, I was wondering if the experiment you're currently conducting happens to involve making Pokémon stick together. "
12,45,155,KODAMA,"Ridiculous! I'm not trying to just get them to stick together. I'm trying to force them into being friendly with one another, fool! "
12,45,156,JESSIE,"What? Oh, please. "
12,45,157,MEOWTH,Hmm! So! This device here is what you use to make that happen? 
12,45,158,KODAMA,Correct. I've dubbed it The Affinity Enabler. 
12,45,159,MEOWTH,"Boy, there's a nifty name that just rolls off the old tongue. - "
12,45,160,KODAMA,"Hey, what was that? - "
12,45,161,MEOWTH,It's beautiful! 
12,45,162,KODAMA,The Affinity Enabler takes the Pokémon move Attract and converts it into a digital signal that is then transmitted using the antenna located on the roof! 
12,45,163,KODAMA,"When Pokémon receive the converted signal, even the bitterest of rivals will change their attitudes and wind up becoming the best of friends! "
12,45,164,JESSIE,"Is he on the level, or is that a bill of goods? "
12,45,165,JAMES,"Looking at that Quagsire and Magnemite gives me disbelieving pause, too. "
12,45,166,KODAMA,"I'm still in the initial stages, but it will work! Thisdevice is groundbreaking in many ways. The Affinity Enabler is highly effective on Pokémon in a similar manner to the move Attract, but is even more powerful as it also works on Pokémon of the same gender, and that is of truly historic proportions! "
12,45,167,QUAGSIRE,[ANGRY] 
12,45,168,KODAMA,But those historic proportions aren't there as of yet. 
12,45,169,JESSIE,I think he means he blew it. 
12,45,170,JAMES,"Yes, truly! Pardon, sir, but have those two Pokémon always been at it like this? "
12,45,171,KODAMA,"Yes, sadly. One Pokémon a Water type, and one an Electric type. Quagsire and Magnemite are totally mismatched for battle, which causes me to wonder why they act so bitter all the time. MAGNEMITE/"
12,45,172,QUAGSIRE,[BATTLING] 
12,45,173,KODAMA,Stop it this instant! 
12,45,174,MAGNEMITE,[ANGRY] 
12,45,175,QUAGSIRE,[ANGRY] 
12,45,176,KODAMA,"See, I love them very much, so I have no choice but to figure out a method to get them to love each other! "
12,45,177,KODAMA,"Well, I suppose I could increase the power! "
12,45,178,PIKACHU,[AFFECTIONATE] 
12,45,179,ASH,Now they're even closer! 
12,45,180,DAWN,"Oh no, Piplup and Pikachu, are you two all right? "
12,45,181,PIKACHU,[AFFECTIONATE] 
12,45,182,RAICHU,[AFFECTIONATE] 
12,45,183,CHILD A,Raichu! 
12,45,184,CHILD C,Marill! 
12,45,185,ASH,I sure wish I could figure out what's up with Water types and Electric types. 
12,45,186,DAWN,It's just so weird! 
12,45,187,BROCK,"Together they usually don't work well, but that's onlyduring a battle, while at other times, they can be the best of friends! "
12,45,188,PIKACHU,[AFFECTIONATE] 
12,45,189,ASH,"What're you thinking of, Brock? "
12,45,190,BROCK,I think it's possible what we're seeing isn't happening naturally. 
12,45,191,DAWN,What do you mean? 
12,45,192,BROCK,There's absolutely no way these two would be acting like this for all sorts of reasons. 
12,45,193,BROCK,"No, the only way this makes sense is if someone is causing this to happen. "
12,45,194,JOY,Who would do that? 
12,45,195,MAGNEMITE,[ANGRY] 
12,45,196,JESSIE,Time to recycle that hunk of junk. 
12,45,197,KODAMA,It has to work! 
12,45,198,KODAMA,I won't give up! I'll make them be best friends if it's the last thing I do! 
12,45,199,JESSIE,Okay. So what's in it for us? 
12,45,200,MEOWTH,I say we swipe that bucket of bolts! 
12,45,201,JAMES,"When you consider the facts, this experiment's a success! "
12,45,202,JESSIE,You two are so strange. 
12,45,203,MEOWTH,"Look, the Twerps are all at the Pokémon Center, where their Pikachu and Piplup are stuck to each other like airplane glue! "
12,45,204,JAMES,And there are scads of Pokémon suffering the same fate. Pairs and pairs of Pokémon plastered as one! 
12,45,205,JESSIE,So how do you explain Quagsire and Magnemite? 
12,45,206,MEOWTH,"That's the -dollar question. But once the ghosties are all gotten out of the machine, that thing's gonna be a real love- and friend-making winner! And that's when we swoop in and scoff it, dig? "
12,45,207,JESSIE,Uh-huh. What do we do with that winner? 
12,45,208,MEOWTH,"Okay, what do you think would happen if Pikachu and I were to become best buds? "
12,45,209,JESSIE,No more battling! 
12,45,210,MEOWTH,That yellow pain in the neck's given us so much grief. 
12,45,211,JESSIE,[THUNDERBOLT MOVE] 
12,45,212,PIKACHU,[AFFECTIONATE] 
12,45,213,MEOWTH,But since BFFs play nice and don't fight each other... 
12,45,214,MEOWTH,"Then at long last we'll be able to catch Pikachu, then give it to the Boss and put this baby to bed! "
12,45,215,JESSIE,I like what you said! 
12,45,216,MEOWTH,"So for now, let's lay low and keep working for theprof until he works out all the kinks, then, whammo! MAGNEMITE/"
12,45,217,QUAGSIRE,[BATTLING] 
12,45,218,JAMES,Not again! 
12,45,219,KODAMA,"Curses! My machine has stopped working altogether, thanks to you! "
12,45,220,RAICHU,[CONFUSED] 
12,45,221,MARILL,[CONFUSED] 
12,45,222,MAREEP,[CONFUSED] 
12,45,223,PIKACHU,[CONFUSED] 
12,45,224,PIPLUP,[CONFUSED] 
12,45,225,ASH,They split! 
12,45,226,DAWN,"Wow, Piplup, are you okay? "
12,45,227,BROCK,That's great! Looks like things are back to normal! 
12,45,228,KODAMA,Please! Can't you two behave so I can get this working? 
12,45,229,PIKACHU,[AFFECTIONATE] 
12,45,230,RAICHU,[AFFECTIONATE] 
12,45,231,MARILL,[AFFECTIONATE] 
12,45,232,MAREEP,[AFFECTIONATE] 
12,45,233,ASH,There they go again. 
12,45,234,DAWN,Something strange is going on. 
12,45,235,CHILD A,Maybe it's for the better. 
12,45,236,CHILD B,What do you mean? 
12,45,237,CHILD A,"Well, if you really think about it, my Raichu and your Squirtle have never gotten along, even before they were ever battling. "
12,45,238,CHILD B,"I guess that's true, but... "
12,45,239,CHILD A,No buts! They'd always get into an argument that stopped them from even starting a battle. 
12,45,240,CHILD A,"Knowing that, this could actually end up working better! "
12,45,241,CHILD B,Well... 
12,45,242,BROCK,Is what you said true? 
12,45,243,DAWN,"What, Brock? "
12,45,244,BROCK,"See, I'm thinking if this is a man-made phenomenon we're all dealing with, wouldn't it also make sense that whoever caused all of this to happen would have Pokémon that don't get along well at all? "
12,45,245,BROCK,"In other words, whoever did this had a reason to cause this to happen so their Pokémon would start getting along with one another! "
12,45,246,JOY,Professor Kodama! 
12,45,247,BROCK,"Who's that, Nurse Joy? "
12,45,248,JOY,Professor Kodama conducts lots of experimental Pokémon research. His research laboratory is located right behind the Pokémon Center. 
12,45,249,ASH,"So, Nurse Joy, you're telling us the professor has Pokémon that don't get along? "
12,45,250,JOY,Right. Quagsire and Magnemite. 
12,45,251,ASH,Quagsire and Magnemite. Water and Electric types! 
12,45,252,ASH,"Can you take us there, Nurse Joy? "
12,45,253,JOY,Follow me! 
12,45,254,JOY,"Professor Kodama, how are you doing? "
12,45,255,KODAMA,Fine. What can I do for you? 
12,45,256,ASH,Have a look at this! 
12,45,257,KODAMA,Amazing! 
12,45,258,ASH,They've been stuck together like this for a while! 
12,45,259,KODAMA,This must mean my experiment's a success! 
12,45,260,DAWN,Experiment? 
12,45,261,ASH,"That's part of it, right? "
12,45,262,KODAMA,"This is the key! I engineered this equipment to bring Pokémon closer to one another! Now, all my years of research have finally paid off! "
12,45,263,QUAGSIRE,[ANGRY] 
12,45,264,MAGNEMITE,[ANGRY] 
12,45,265,ASH,Why aren't Quagsire and Magnemite getting along? 
12,45,266,DAWN,They're Water and Electric types. So why aren't they being friendly? 
12,45,267,KODAMA,Good question. I'm working on that one. 
12,45,268,BROCK,That's strange. 
12,45,269,JESSIE,So why don't you all lighten up? We'll get there! 
12,45,270,JAMES,"This is no place for amateurs, so why don't you all leave? "
12,45,271,JOY,And you are? 
12,45,272,JESSIE,"Why, we're Professor Kodama's well-trained assistants! "
12,45,273,JOY,I don't remember any assistants! 
12,45,274,JAMES,We're part of the Jobs in a Jif program! 
12,45,275,MEOWTH,"Anyway, back to the grind. "

12,45,281,JESSIE,Those Twerpish dummies prove it's time to move this along! - 
12,45,282,JAMES,And how! - 
12,45,283,KODAMA,"Hey, where do you think you're going, Team Racket? I mean, Team Rocket? "
12,45,284,JESSIE,There's nothing worse than a brainy big mouth! 
12,45,285,JAMES,Except Twerps with big ears. 
12,45,286,ASH,"All right, that's it! "
12,45,287,JESSIE,"We're busted, so off with my disguise! "
12,45,288,JAMES,There's lots of time left to feed you more lies! - 
12,45,289,JESSIE,On the wind! - 
12,45,290,JAMES,Past the stars! 
12,45,291,MEOWTH,"My, how time flies! "
12,45,292,JESSIE,Bringing you chaos at a breakneck pace! 
12,45,293,JAMES,Dashing all hope and putting fear in its place! 
12,45,294,JESSIE,A rose by any other name's just as sweet! 
12,45,295,JAMES,"When everything's worse, our work is complete! - "
12,45,296,JESSIE,Jessie! - 
12,45,297,JAMES,And it's James! 
12,45,298,MEOWTH,"Meowth, that's a name! "
12,45,299,JESSIE,Putting goofy do-gooders in their place! 
12,45,300,JAMES,We're Team Rocket!

12,45,302,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
12,45,303,ASH,It's Team Rocket! 
12,45,304,DAWN,What have you got up your sleeve this time? 
12,45,305,MEOWTH,Forget up our sleeve! We're taking that machine up in the air! There! 
12,45,306,ASH,What are you doing?! 
12,45,307,MEOWTH,"Two points! From now on, just call me the sultan of strategy! "
12,45,308,KODAMA,Where do you think you're going? - 
12,45,309,JOY,Professor! - 
12,45,310,JAMES,"Excellent! By accompanying us, the good professor can address any remaining techno issues! "
12,45,311,ASH,Hold it! 
12,45,312,PIKACHU,[CONFUSED]

12,45,318,MEOWTH,"Piplup, too! "
12,45,319,PIPLUP,[AFFECTIONATE] - 
12,45,320,ASH,"Pikachu, no! - "
12,45,321,DAWN,Piplup! 
12,45,322,JAMES,Yes! A Pikachu in the hand! 
12,45,323,JESSIE,And it packs much less of a jolt without that Thunderbolt. - 
12,45,324,JESSIE,What a dolt! - 
12,45,325,ASH,Pikachu!

12,45,332,KODAMA,Magnemite! - 
12,45,333,ASH,Now what? 
12,45,334,BROCK,It's trying to save Professor Kodama!

12,45,341,ASH,"Hey, I don't get it! "
12,45,342,ASH,I thought those two couldn't stand the sight of each other! 
12,45,343,BROCK,So maybe they didn't hate each other after all. Maybe they were just having a little battle practice! 
12,45,344,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] - 
12,45,345,ASH,It's Pikachu! - 
12,45,346,DAWN,And Piplup! 
12,45,347,BROCK,They're both back to normal after the machine fell apart! 
12,45,348,ASH,"Okay, Staraptor, go on up and bring back Pikachu and Piplup safe and sound! "

12,45,357,ASH,"Pikachu, use Thunderbolt, let's go! "
12,45,358,DAWN,"And Piplup, use Bubble Beam! "
12,45,359,PIPLUP,[att*ck] 
12,45,360,JESSIE,Your stupid strategies are slick as sandpaper! 
12,45,361,MEOWTH,"Look at the bright side! When we want a k*ller Thunderbolt or Bubble Beam, we know just who to call! "
12,45,362,JAMES,"I need those att*cks like I need a hole in my head, which, thanks to Carnivine, I have an abundance of! "
12,45,363,JESSIE,We're blasting off again! 
12,45,364,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
12,45,365,CHILDREN [X],[HAPPY] 
12,45,366,KODAMA,"And after all we went through, it still didn't work on Quagsire or Magnemite. "
12,45,367,BROCK,"Maybe it's because Quagsire's a Ground type as well as a Water type, and Magnemite is a Steel type as well as an Electric type. That just might have something to do with it. "
12,45,368,KODAMA,"You know, that might be it! "
12,45,369,KODAMA,It looks like I now know exactly what my next research project will be! So! I'd better stop lollygagging and get to work! 
12,45,370,JOY,And I do hope it goes easier next time.

12,44,8,ASH,"Nah! That's nothing but superstition. And plus, it's not even night yet. "

12,44,19,GIRATINA,"[ROARING] Sometimes it's hard to know, Which way you're supposed to go. But deep inside, you know you're strong. If you follow your heart, you can't be wrong. Stand up! [Stand up!] For what is right. Be brave! Get ready to fight. Hold on! [Hold on!] We're friends for life. And if we come, together as one, Complete the quest, that we've begun, We will win the battle! Galactic Battles! Pokémon! "
12,44,20,BROCK,"Well, I think we're all safe now! "
12,44,21,ASH,"Man, my heart. "
12,44,22,PIKACHU,[EXHAUSTED] 
12,44,23,DAWN,Hold on a sec. Do you hear that? 
12,44,24,"ASH, PIKACHU",[SCARED] 
12,44,25,"DAWN, PIPLUP",[SHOCKED] 
12,44,26,"ASH, DAWN, BROCK",Uh oh! 
12,44,27,RHYANNA,"Come on! Snap out of it, please! "
12,44,28,"ASH, BROCK, DAWN","Help, help, I'm drowning, help me! Help me, please! "
12,44,29,ASH,"Hold on. What just happened, guys? "
12,44,30,RHYANNA,What you all just experienced was an illusion from Murkrow's Confuse Ray. 
12,44,31,BROCK,"Hi! I'm Brock, and I'm not really confused! I'm sure your beauty is as real as real gets, unless you somehow could be an illusion that Murkrow's Confuse Ray created, too! "
12,44,32,BROCK,No confusion there. 
12,44,33,CROAGUNK,[CROAKING] 
12,44,34,DAWN,Don't give it a second thought. It happens all the time! - 
12,44,35,ASH,"Hi, I'm Ash! - "
12,44,36,DAWN,I'm Dawn. 
12,44,37,RHYANNA,I'm Rhyanna. I live in a village very close to the forest. 
12,44,38,DAWN,"Well, thank you so much for helping us out. "
12,44,39,BROCK,"So how did you know we were seeing illusions, then? "
12,44,40,DAWN,Some fast recovery. 
12,44,41,RHYANNA,That's an easy one. The reason why I know is that Murkrow is my brother's Pokémon. 
12,44,42,MITCHELL,Murkrow! 
12,44,43,MURKROW,[SURPRISED] 
12,44,44,MITCHELL,All right. 
12,44,45,ASH,"Tell me, why do you think your brother would go and do something like that? "
12,44,46,RHYANNA,"He's never been like this before. To tell you the truth, I haven't the foggiest idea. Mitchell's a Pokémon Trainer, like me. Whenever we had the time, we always used to battle each other. "
12,44,47,RHYANNA,"Okay, Misdreavus, go! "
12,44,48,MISDREAVUS,[APPEARING] 
12,44,49,MITCHELL,"Now, Murkrow, come on out! "
12,44,50,MURKROW,[APPEARING] 
12,44,51,RHYANNA,"Rhyanna, ready to go? "
12,44,52,MITCHELL,Sure! Bring it on! 
12,44,53,MURKROW,[STUNNED] 
12,44,54,MITCHELL,"No, Murkrow! "
12,44,55,MURKROW,[WEAK] 
12,44,56,MITCHELL,"Better watch out. I'm b*ating you next time, Rhyanna! "
12,44,57,RHYANNA,"Mitchell and I were constantly competing against each other. So I guess that made the two of us true rivals. But one day, Mitchell suddenly decided to go up on the mountain and train with Murkrow. "
12,44,58,RHYANNA,"And that's when he started playing pranks on travelers, like today with you. "
12,44,59,ASH,"Oh, man. "
12,44,60,DAWN,Why not just ask your brother why he does that? 
12,44,61,RHYANNA,"He's always avoiding me, so I can't! Like, whenever I try to talk to him, he just runs. And that's why I've been looking so hard for a Dusk Stone. "
12,44,62,ASH,Dusk Stone? 
12,44,63,PIKACHU,[CURIOUS] 
12,44,64,RHYANNA,Right. There should be a Dusk Stone somewhere in the forest. I'm going to use it to evolve my Misdreavus into a Mismagius! 
12,44,65,ASH,But why do that? 
12,44,66,RHYANNA,"It's what I heard from Grandpa! He said Mismagius can chant spells that may bring people happiness! Now maybe if I were to use that spell on Mitchell, then... "
12,44,67,BROCK,"Then perhaps you and Mitchell will make up, right? "
12,44,68,DAWN,Do you think Mitchell would be happy with a spell? 
12,44,69,RHYANNA,Don't know. But I've kind of run out of ideas. 
12,44,70,BROCK,"Now, Rhyanna, wipe the sorrow from those pretty eyes! Ah, if I could only rid you of your sadness for just a little while! Of course! The only thing for me to do, Rhyanna, is pitch in and help you! "
12,44,71,RHYANNA,You will? I'm just thrilled! 
12,44,72,BROCK,"Oh no, I'm the thrilled one! Because... "
12,44,73,JAMES,Now there's some news of note! A spell that takes people to their happy place! 
12,44,74,JESSIE,"Music to my fine-tuned ears! I heard every wonderful word! It's true girls just want to have fun, but just have fun happily! "
12,44,75,MEOWTH,"True! But I wanna have fun, too! "
12,44,76,JESSIE,"Well, in order for us to hop on the happiness express, we need that Dusk Stone pronto! I'm on it! This one. This one! No, it's this one! "
12,44,77,JAMES,I doubt Jessie would know a Dusk Stone if it gave her a back bite. 
12,44,78,MEOWTH,"And though I'd love to see it, that ain't happening. "
12,44,79,JESSIE,"Busted. I figured since dusk is around the corner, the Dusk Fairy would turn every stone into a Dusk Stone is that so wrong? "
12,44,80,JAMES,Jess. Cheer up! I have a secret w*apon just for an occasion like this! Presenting... My newly patented Dusk Stone Detection Device! 
12,44,81,JESSIE,Please. Wire rods? 
12,44,82,MEOWTH,No Dusk Stone in its right mind's showing up for those! 
12,44,83,JAMES,"These are what are commonly called dowsing rods. Since days of old, they've been used to locate underground minerals of all kinds. As we close in on the Dusk Stone, these rods will open wide! "
12,44,84,JAMES,"See? It's not there, and that proves it! "
12,44,85,JESSIE,Then it's off to find our happiness elsewhere! 
12,44,86,MEOWTH,Dowsing our troubles away! 
12,44,87,BROCK,"Rhyanna, what's that? "
12,44,88,RHYANNA,"Grandpa told me about that, too! Back when he was young, he said people used to mine Dusk Stones somewhere near this shrine. "
12,44,89,DAWN,"Wow, maybe there are some of them left. "
12,44,90,RHYANNA,"The problem is I've looked around here several times, but I've never found anything. "
12,44,91,BROCK,We'll help you find a Dusk Stone! 
12,44,92,ASH,Yeah! Let's split up and look! 
12,44,93,RHYANNA,Thanks so much! 
12,44,94,BROCK,"All right, Ash and Dawn, why don't you two look over there? - "
12,44,95,ASH,Right! - 
12,44,96,DAWN,Got it! 
12,44,97,BROCK,How about this? Let's ask your Misdreavus to come out and give us a hand while we look for it! 
12,44,98,RHYANNA,Misdreavus? 
12,44,99,BROCK,Murkrow and Misdreavus are the only Pokémon that evolve with a Dusk Stone! So maybe Misdreavus might be able to find it. 
12,44,100,RHYANNA,"Wow, I never even thought of that. It sounds like it just might work. Okay! Let's do it now! Misdreavus, go! "
12,44,101,MISDREAVUS,[APPEARING] 
12,44,102,RHYANNA,Would you please help us find a Dusk Stone? 
12,44,103,MISDREAVUS,[CURIOUS] 
12,44,104,RHYANNA,I think Misdreavus is sensing something! 
12,44,105,BROCK,Let's go check it out. 
12,44,106,MISDREAVUS,[FOCUSED] 
12,44,107,DAWN,"Now, Piplup, if you find a Dusk Stone, you let us know right away, all right? "
12,44,108,PIPLUP,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
12,44,109,MURKROW,[att*ck] 
12,44,110,PIPLUP,[CURIOUS] / [PAINED] 
12,44,111,DAWN,It's that Murkrow! 
12,44,112,ASH,"Well, we're not falling for it again! Pikachu! Use Thunderbolt, let's go! "
12,44,113,PIKACHU,[THUNDERBOLT MOVE] 
12,44,114,MURKROW,[STUNNED] 
12,44,115,ASH,"Yes! Pikachu, that was great! "
12,44,116,MITCHELL,"Murkrow, no! "
12,44,117,MITCHELL,All right! What're you doing to my Murkrow? 
12,44,118,ASH,"Now hold on a minute, you two are the ones who snuck up on us! "
12,44,119,DAWN,So you're Mitchell? Why do you pull pranks on people like that? 
12,44,120,MITCHELL,Knock it off! 
12,44,121,ASH,"Look, your sister's worried about you. "
12,44,122,MITCHELL,Give me a break. She doesn't care about me at all. 
12,44,123,DAWN,"Hey, that's a lie! She's looking for a Dusk Stone because she wants to evolve her Misdreavus into a Mismagius to try to make you happy with its spell, see? "
12,44,124,MISDREAVUS,[CONFIDENT] 
12,44,125,RHYANNA,"Wow, Misdreavus's cries are getting a lot louder. "
12,44,126,BROCK,"Yeah! And I think we might be closing in on a Dusk Stone, and fast. "
12,44,127,JAMES,"Whoa. Oh. Ho ho! Closer, closer, closer, closer, closer, closer. Dusk Stone, bingo! Any closer and we'd be behind it. "
12,44,128,JESSIE,Happy times! 
12,44,129,MEOWTH,I'm gonna get a happy place of my own! 
12,44,130,MEOWTH,Dig that door! I'll bet someone dug that door to dig in that mine. 
12,44,131,JESSIE,Maybe digging for a Dusk Stone? 
12,44,132,JAMES,You see? Dowsing's the real deal for a determined digger! 
12,44,133,JESSIE,Just think. We could wind up unearthing a darling Dusk Stone family or two! 
12,44,134,JAMES,It's great! It's our fate! Happy days await! 
12,44,135,MEOWTH,"Hey, when we get our paws on that Dusk Stone, we could evolve a Mismagius for a gift to the Boss. "
12,44,136,MEOWTH,Think of when he gets home from a lousy day at the office! 
12,44,137,GIOVANNI [MEOWTH],Oy! This has gotta be the worst day of my dictatorial life! 
12,44,138,MISMAGIUS [MEOWTH],[FOCUSED] 
12,44,139,GIOVANNI [MEOWTH],There's nothing like a Mismagius spell to keep the ol' Boss thinking happy thoughts! I'd take your spells over a massage any day. 
12,44,140,"GIOVANNI, [MEOWTH]",And this day is a perfect day to give Meowth and his friends a happy time they'll never forget! 
12,44,141,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",We're playing it cool! Happiness rules! We're rich! 
12,44,142,JESSIE,"Uh, of course, when we find the Dusk Stone, we'll have to catch a Misdreavus, too. "
12,44,143,JAMES,It would be handy if one were just lying around! 
12,44,144,MEOWTH,"Hate to burst your bubble, bud, but this is real life, not a movie. "
12,44,145,MISDREAVUS,[FOCUSED] A Misdreavus! 
12,44,146,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH","Lights, camera, action! "
12,44,147,ASH,"C'mon, Mitchell, wait up! "
12,44,148,"DAWN, PIKACHU",[PANTING] - 
12,44,149,ASH,Stop! - 
12,44,150,MITCHELL,"Look! Let go of me! I need to go and find the Dusk Stone before my sister does, see? "
12,44,151,DAWN,But the reason why Rhyanna's looking for the Dusk Stone is to help you out. 
12,44,152,MITCHELL,"Ha! Rhyanna doesn't care about me. The only reason she wants to evolve her Misdreavus into a Mismagius is so she can b*at me every time we battle, and that's all. "
12,44,153,ASH,"Well, that's not what Rhyanna told us by a long sh*t! "
12,44,154,DAWN,What makes you think that anyway? 
12,44,155,MITCHELL,Okay. 
12,44,156,MURKROW,[STUNNED] 
12,44,157,MITCHELL,"No, Murkrow! "
12,44,158,MITCHELL,"See, every time we battle, Rhyanna always beats me! Obviously I want to b*at her, so I decided to go train up on the mountain and become stronger. "
12,44,159,MURKROW,[EXERTION] 
12,44,160,MITCHELL,Hit it! Use Wing att*ck! 
12,44,161,MURKROW,[IMPACT] 
12,44,162,MITCHELL,That's not what I said! Use Wing att*ck! 
12,44,163,MURKROW,[IMPACT] / [ANGRY] 
12,44,164,MITCHELL,"Hey! Where are you going? Murkrow, come back here! "
12,44,165,MITCHELL,That's it. Now Murkrow won't listen to a single thing I tell it. 
12,44,166,DAWN,"Wait, are you saying you had nothing to do with Murkrow's Confuse Ray or any of those illusions we saw? "
12,44,167,MITCHELL,"Right! Nothing. If you want to know the truth, the whole thing is Rhyanna's fault, period! "
12,44,168,DAWN,Wait! I don't think you should blame Rhyanna. 
12,44,169,DAWN,Yeah You should think more about your Pokémon's feelings! 
12,44,170,ASH,You're never gonna get strong unless you and Murkrow work as a team. Maybe you ought to start thinking about Murkrow's feelings instead of yours! 
12,44,171,MITCHELL,"Use Wing att*ck! C'mon, hit it, hit it! "
12,44,172,MURKROW,[IMPACT] 
12,44,173,MITCHELL,"I never thought of that. I'm so sorry, Murkrow. I was angry that I couldn't b*at Rhyanna. So I took it out on you. It must have hurt, getting hit all those times... "
12,44,174,MURKROW,[WEAK] 
12,44,175,JESSIE,"Two Twerps! The taller one, alongside a taller Twerpette! "
12,44,176,RHYANNA,Where are we? I've never seen this in the forest! 
12,44,177,BROCK,Do you think this is the place your grandfather was talking about when he said they used to mine for Dusk Stones around here? 
12,44,178,MISDREAVUS,[CURIOUS] 
12,44,179,MISDREAVUS,[EXCITED] 
12,44,180,RHYANNA,Misdreavus? Something over there? 
12,44,181,BROCK,"Rhyanna, look! That stone! "
12,44,182,RHYANNA,We found it! It's a Dusk Stone! 
12,44,183,BROCK,So we did! 
12,44,184,RHYANNA,Thank you! I never would have found it if it wasn't for you and your hard work. 
12,44,185,BROCK,"Well, thanks to Misdreavus! "
12,44,186,MISDREAVUS,[CURIOUS] / [SCARED] -

12,44,190,RHYANNA,Now who in the world are you supposed to be? 
12,44,191,JESSIE,We're out of this world. can't you tell by our suave demeanor? 
12,44,192,JAMES,Our grass is always greener! - 
12,44,193,JESSIE,On the wind! - 
12,44,194,JAMES,The stars! 
12,44,195,MEOWTH,Neener neener! 
12,44,196,JESSIE,Happy searching at a breakneck pace! 
12,44,197,JAMES,Dashing hope with a smile on my face! 
12,44,198,JESSIE,Joy by any other name's just as happy! 
12,44,199,JAMES,While you Twerps are so sappy. - 
12,44,200,JESSIE,Jessie! - 
12,44,201,JAMES,And James! 
12,44,202,MEOWTH,Meowth's the name!

12,44,209,RHYANNA,"Give me back my Misdreavus, now! "
12,44,210,JESSIE,No! You think I'm handing over my happiness to a Twerp with a 'tude? 
12,44,211,JAMES,"We're soon to evolve this Misdreavus utilizing a Dusk Stone, and then Mismagius will happy us to our hearts' content. "
12,44,212,MEOWTH,"One Dusk Stone, please, and make it fast! "
12,44,213,RHYANNA,"No way! Misdreavus, rip the net and come here! "
12,44,214,MEOWTH,"Nope! This may come as a shock, but... "
12,44,215,RHYANNA,Misdreavus!

12,44,303,RHYANNA,We did it! 
12,44,304,BROCK,"Maybe this would be a good time to talk, since it was a misunderstanding and nothing more. "
12,44,305,MITCHELL,"Rhyanna, I'm sorry. "
12,44,306,RHYANNA,"No. I'm the one who should be sorry. I assumed those pranks were yours. So, what should we do with this stone? I don't need to evolve Misdreavus into Mismagius anymore, because you don't need a happiness spell anymore! "
12,44,307,MITCHELL,Hey! How about whoever wins the most battles out of  gets the stone? - 
12,44,308,RHYANNA,Yeah! Great idea! -

12,44,315,NARRATOR,"Family disputes can arise, but in Rhyanna and Mitchell's situation, a little help from our heroes has settled their disagreement once and for all! And now that Ash has drawn training inspiration from new friends, the journey continues"
12,43,0,NARRATOR,"With the Lilypad Pokémon Contest behind them, our Heroes have decided to stop by the colosseum ruins on the outskirts of Lilypad Town. "
12,43,1,ASH,"Whoa, the colosseum! "
12,43,2,PIKACHU,[AMAZED] 
12,43,3,BROCK,"In the Sinnoh region's ancient times, this is where true champion Trainers worked with their Pokémon to strengthen both body and spirit! "

12,43,5,KHOURY,My last day in Sinnoh I think it'll be a day I'll remember forever! 
12,43,6,LYRA,Yeah! 
12,43,7,DAWN,"So, Khoury, didn't you tell us that you're going tomeet your father at the airport? "

12,43,18,DAWN,It's Dialga and Palkia! 
12,43,19,BROCK,They're Legendary Pokémon from the Sinnoh region! 
12,43,20,LYRA,Legendary? Really? Cool! 
12,43,21,KHOURY,So this colosseum's really important! 
12,43,22,DAWN,"Yeah, I've heard there's a legend that says: Trainers' and breeders' wishes come true when they touch the statues then train Pokémon! Of course, I wonder if it's real. "
12,43,23,LYRA,Let's find out! 
12,43,24,ASH,I'm up for it!

12,43,31,LYRA,"Well duh! To go back and win the Johto League, of course! - But there's one more thing. - "
12,43,32,DAWN,What's that? 
12,43,33,LYRA,"After I get back to Johto, I'd like to go on a journey with a really good friend of mine! "
12,43,34,KHOURY,"Hey! You were really thinking about that, Lyra? "
12,43,35,ASH,You can cheer each other on and help each other grow and get stronger on your journey when you're with a friend! 
12,43,36,PIKACHU,[AGREEMENT] 
12,43,37,BROCK,"So Dawn, I'll bet you probably wished you'd win your next contest! "

12,43,128,KHOURY,It's obvious these Pokémon living along the river are using Dig to get away from something! 
12,43,129,KHOURY,I think that's evidence that Team Rocket must've passed right through here!

12,43,284,KHOURY,"They both took so much damage, Lyra! What do we do now? "
12,43,285,LYRA,"Remember, Khoury, we'll win this for sure as long as we believe in our Pokémon! "
12,43,286,LYRA,"Come on, get up Chikori - ta! You can do it! "

12,43,295,CROCONAW,[PROUD] 
12,43,296,KHOURY,Wow! Totodile evolved into Croconaw! 
12,43,297,LYRA,So that's Croconaw huh! 
12,43,298,LYRA'S POKEDEX [M],"Croconaw. The Big Jaw Pokémon, and the evolved form of Totodile. "
12,43,299,LYRA'S POKEDEX [M],"Once it bites down on something, it won't let go until it loses its fangs, but new fangs grow back quickly. "
12,43,300,CROCONAW,[EXCITED] 
12,43,301,KHOURY'S POKEDEX [M],"The moves Croconaw is able to use areBite, Aqua Tail, Super Power and Hydro Pump. "
12,43,302,KHOURY,"Croconaw, you can use lots of great moves! Okay! Croconaw, Hydro Pump let's go! "
12,43,303,CROCONAW,[HYDRO PUMP MOVE] 
12,43,304,"MONFERNO, CYNDAQUIL",[PAINED][PAINED] 
12,43,305,KHOURY,That Hydro Pump worked like a charm! 
12,43,306,DAWN,It's obvious with that kind of power Croconaw's stronger than Totodile was! 
12,43,307,ASH,"Hey, Monferno, get up now! "
12,43,308,MONFERNO,[DETERMINED]

12,43,341,MONFERNO,[PLEASED] 
12,43,342,DAWN,"Wow, Cyndaquil, you were amazing as well! "
12,43,343,CYNDAQUIL,[PLEASED] 
12,43,344,KHOURY,"You know, Lyra, using Light Screen to weaken their att*ck and then counterstrike... I thought it was a good strategy! "
12,43,345,LYRA,"But don't forget, we were up against Ash with seven badges and Dane with four ribbons! The strategy may have been good, but it wasn't enough, that's all! "
12,43,346,ASH,"But I've got to tell you, Totodile evolving into Croconaw was the biggest surprise of all! "
12,43,347,BROCK,"I'll tell you, Ash and Dawn's teamwork was something to see! But the team of Khoury and Lyra worked together just as well. "
12,43,348,BROCK,"Honestly, I really wasn't sure who was going to win it! "
12,43,349,DAWN,"Well Cyndaquil hasn't had much Battle experience, so this was perfect! "
12,43,350,BROCK,"Lyra, there's no doubt that you're going to be a great Trainer and Khoury a great breeder one of these days! "
12,43,351,BROCK,Just make sure you keep working together to support each other just like today! 
12,43,352,LYRA,Together? 
12,43,353,KHOURY,"Oh hello, Dad! "
12,43,354,KHOURY'S FATHER,"Nice to see you, Khoury! I've just arrived here at the airport so I wanted to give a call and find out where I should meet you when you two get here. "
12,43,355,KHOURY,I totally forgot! The Johto flight is leaving any minute! 
12,43,356,LYRA,Oh no! We've gotta move! 
12,43,357,KHOURY'S FATHER,Khoury! 
12,43,358,KHOURY,Made it! 
12,43,359,LYRA,And got in right under the wire too! 
12,43,360,KHOURY,"Hey, Brock, thanks for everything! "
12,43,361,KHOURY,There's still so much more I want to learn though! 
12,43,362,BROCK,"Just remember that the number one job of a breeder is connecting with Pokémon! All you need is more time to meet with different types - and Trainers and Coordinators, you know! "
12,43,363,KHOURY,Right! I'll do my best! 
12,43,364,LYRA,"Hey I know! When we get back to Johto, Khoury, let's go on a journey together! "
12,43,365,LYRA,"You said so yourself that it's great to be around friends, right? "
12,43,366,LYRA,"Think of you and me togther. We'd really be able to help each other sharpen up our skills, you know? "
12,43,367,KHOURY,This is such a surprise! I can't believe you'd ask me to do that. 
12,43,368,LYRA,Does that mean...no? 
12,43,369,KHOURY,"The reason Totodile evolved was because of you, Lyra! I think - the intense way you believe in your Pokémon got transferred over to Totodile somehow! "
12,43,370,LYRA,Khoury! 
12,43,371,KHOURY,"I'm sure of it! When I'm with you, it feels like greatthings are going to happen all of the time! And so I'd like to go with you. "
12,43,372,LYRA,Well...it's my pleasure! 
12,43,373,ASH,Of course! Truth is there's nothing like good friends! 
12,43,374,ASH,"And Lyra, I just know you're going to get your third Johto Badge too! "
12,43,375,PIKACHU,[AGREEMENT] 
12,43,376,BROCK,"And to win it you'll be battling. ...Whitney from the Goldenrod Gym, or Morty from the Ecruteak Gym! "
12,43,377,BROCK,They're both really strong! 
12,43,378,LYRA,No problem! I'll just have to do my best no matter who it is! 
12,43,379,LYRA,Hey Ash - you're going for your eighth Sinnoh Gym badge right? 
12,43,380,ASH,"Yeah! If I win at the Sunyshore Gym, then it'll finally be time to be in the Sinnoh League! "
12,43,381,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
12,43,382,LYRA,"And lots of luck to you on your fifth ribbon, Dane! "
12,43,383,DAWN,Thanks! I'll get number five for sure and that's going to get me to the Grand Festival! 
12,43,384,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
12,43,385,KHOURY'S FATHER,It's obvious that my son owes you a lot for all the help you've given him! 
12,43,386,KHOURY'S FATHER,I'm grateful! So please accept this little gift. 
12,43,387,"BROCK, ASH, DAWN, LYRA, KHOURY, PIKACHU",[SURPRISED][SURPRISED] 
12,43,388,LYRA,Cool! A Pokégear! - 
12,43,389,ASH,"Whoa, you sure? - "
12,43,390,KHOURY'S FATHER,Of course! 
12,43,391,BROCK,Thank you so much! 
12,43,392,KHOURY,Brock? Do you think I could call you ifI ever need any help or advice? 
12,43,393,BROCK,Sure. Anything you want is fine. 
12,43,394,NARRATOR,"And so, as Lyra and Khoury wing their way back home to Johto, we leave our Heroes as they gear up for their journey to Sunyshore City and the Gym battle that may provide Ash with his eighth Sinnoh badge, so stay tuned"
12,42,0,NARRATOR,"Lilypad Town, where our Heroes have arrived for the Lilypad Town Pokémon Contest! And with Dawn's fifth ribbon on the line, some intense training with Mamoswine is now in full swing! "

12,42,6,"GROTLE, MAMOSWINE",[SWALLOWING][SWALLOWING] - 
12,42,7,LYRA,"Whoa, they ate them? - "
12,42,8,KHOURY,Why'd they do that? 
12,42,9,BROCK,"It all began back with an energy charge that Grotlediscovered by accident! You see, if a Pokémon swallows a move that's the same type as itself and then releases the energy throughout its body... "
12,42,10,ASH,Yes! 
12,42,11,CYNDAQUIL,[AMAZED] - 
12,42,12,DAWN,It worked great! - 
12,42,13,LYRA,Amazing! 
12,42,14,BROCK,Mamoswine really gets it now!

12,42,35,DAWN,"Sweet Cyndaquil... See, if you cheer us on, it'll really energize us and then the Lilypad ribbon is as good as ours! Okay, dear? "

12,42,37,CYNDAQUIL,[EXCITED] / [EXERTION] - 
12,42,38,LYRA,"Dane, are you okay? - "
12,42,39,DAWN,"No need to worry. I know this - Today I get my fifth ribbon! Sometimes it's hard to know, Which way you're supposed to go. But deep inside, you know you're strong. If you follow your heart, you can't be wrong. Stand up! [Stand up!] For what is right. Be brave! Get ready to fight. Hold on! [Hold on!] We're friends for life. And if we come, together as one, Complete the quest, that we've begun, We will win the battle! Galactic Battles! Pokémon! "

12,42,44,JAMES,You're ill! First conquer your cold then compete in your contest! 
12,42,45,MEOWTH,"Look, sicko, I think you'd better sit this one out... "
12,42,46,JESSIE,Sit this one - out? I don't know the meaning of the phrase! Forget it! I refuse to throw in the towel! Top Coordinator is my life! 
12,42,47,JAMES,"Stop, woman! "

12,42,57,DAWN,Really? 
12,42,58,LYRA,"Yeah, you're number one of the bunch, no doubt! Hey Ash, don't you think so too? "
12,42,59,ASH,Of course she's number one! Because Dawn's gonna win!

12,42,61,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
12,42,62,PIPLUP,[GRATEFUL] 
12,42,63,LYRA,That's not what I meant by 'number one. It went over Ash'shead didn't it? -

12,42,72,LYRA,You know each other? 
12,42,73,LYRA,Oh cool! 
12,42,74,LYRA,This outfit is adorable! So where did you get it? 
12,42,75,JAMESILINA [JAMES],"Well, you see...uh...The store name escapes me! Okay then - Ta ta for now! "
12,42,76,JAMESILINA [JAMES],This can't be good for my heart. This is an idea whose time has not come! 
12,42,77,MEOWTH,Suck it up and be more confident! That's the way Jessie always rolls and you know it! 
12,42,78,JAMESILINA [JAMES],"Perhaps so, but Jessie's a Coordinator and I'm anything but! I regret to say I'm going to lose round one - and get out of this milieu. - "
12,42,79,MEOWTH,I don't think so! 
12,42,80,JAMESILINA [JAMES],What? How dare you! 
12,42,81,MEOWTH,"Look, if you don't win this milieu, Jessie's going to stay sick! "
12,42,82,JAMESILINA [JAMES],Perish the thought. 
12,42,83,MARIAN,So let's begin with round one! Each Coordinator's Pokémon will display an array of dazzling moves on the Performance Stage! And here's entrant number one! You're on! - 
12,42,84,LYRA,"All right, there's Dane! - "
12,42,85,ASH,Go Dawn! Show them! 
12,42,86,KHOURY,So what's the Performance Stage? 
12,42,87,BROCK,It's the round where Coordinators see who shows off their Pokémon and their moves the best! 
12,42,88,ASH,You'll see. Just wait! 
12,42,89,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
12,42,90,DAWN,Piplup! Spot light! 
12,42,91,PIPLUP,[APPEARING] 
12,42,92,LYRA,How could a Poké Ball do that? 
12,42,93,BROCK,That comes from what's called a Ball Capsule and Seal which can create all sorts of different special effects and make a Pokémon's entrance really shine! 
12,42,94,KHOURY,"Wow! Say, that's what I call cool! "
12,42,95,DAWN,"Now, Piplup, Whirlpool, go! "
12,42,96,PIPLUP,[WHIRLPOOL MOVE] 
12,42,97,DAWN,Follow it with Bide!

12,42,99,LYRA,Piplup's using Bide? 
12,42,100,KHOURY,"Yeah, but Piplup's not being att*cked by anyone! "
12,42,101,MARIAN,Piplup's Whirlpool's coming straight down on it! 
12,42,102,PIPLUP,[BIDE MOVE] 
12,42,103,MARIAN,"And now Bide and Whirlpool have joined forces, leaving Piplup glowing an intense blue from the energy reaction! "
12,42,104,DAWN,"Piplup, we did it! "
12,42,105,PIPLUP,[PROUD] 
12,42,106,ASH,They sure nailed that one! 
12,42,107,PIKACHU,[CHEERING] 
12,42,108,CYNDAQUIL,[CHEERING] 
12,42,109,KHOURY,"It was really obvious Dawn wanted to show off Piplup's blue body, don't you think? "
12,42,110,LYRA,I thought so too! Wow! I guess you could say the first round is kind of like a talent show! - 
12,42,111,KHOURY,Works for me! - 
12,42,112,ASH,A talent show? 
12,42,113,PIKACHU,[CONFUSED] MR. 
12,42,114,CONTESTA,That truly was an impressive example of a performance of the highest caliber! MR. 
12,42,115,SUKIZO,Remarkable too!

12,42,124,"JAMESILINA, [JAMES]",The things I endure to keep the peace. 
12,42,125,"JAMESILINA, [JAMES]","All righty then Meowth, Rocket Launch!! "
12,42,126,MARIAN,An entrance without a Ball Capsule! Unique! 
12,42,127,"JAMESILINA, [JAMES]","This goes out to all the noodle fans in TV land! Meowth, use Fury Swipes! "
12,42,128,MARIAN,Look at that Fury Swipes go! 
12,42,129,LYRA,Whoa! Now that's what I would call lightning - fast speed! 
12,42,130,MARIAN,A standing ovation! The audience is going wild over seeing a performance style that's fresh and new - standing the normal fare of contest performances on its head! 
12,42,131,"JAMESILINA, [JAMES]",Here you go! It's Meowth's noodle special so please eat up while it's still hot! 
12,42,132,ASH,Looks good!

12,42,135,LYRA,You see? It is a talent show! 
12,42,136,KHOURY,But such an unusual performance! MR. 
12,42,137,CONTESTA,Who would've thought using Fury Swipes could make delicious noodles? MR. 
12,42,138,SUKIZO,Remarkable too! 
12,42,139,NURSE JOY,The noodles are al dente - great broth too! 
12,42,140,DAWN,I can't believe that Jessilina changed her style again. 
12,42,141,MEOWTH,"Man, I'm on top of the world! "
12,42,142,"JAMESILINA, [JAMES]",Yeah! I could get used to this kind of worship! 
12,42,143,JESSIE,Louder cheers than me? I demand a recount! 
12,42,144,MARIAN,Ladies and Gentlemen that brings us to the end of an exciting round one - so please be patient while our judges' results are tabulated! 
12,42,145,LYRA,"You were awesome, Piplup! "
12,42,146,PIPLUP,[PROUD] 
12,42,147,LYRA,"Wow, Dane, contests are really fun to watch you know? "
12,42,148,DAWN,"Glad you like it, Lyra! "
12,42,149,LYRA,But still...waiting for the results can sure be a nerve wracking time! 
12,42,150,ASH,No need to worry! Piplup really did great out there! 
12,42,151,"JAMESILINA, [JAMES]",These contests aren't half bad! My gleeful ears are still ringing with cheers! 
12,42,152,MEOWTH,Yeah! I'm in my happy place. 
12,42,153,MARIAN,"And now Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you again for your patience! "
12,42,154,MARIAN,After careful consideration by our panel of judges the eight Coordinators who will be moving along to round two are on the big screen now! - 
12,42,155,JESSIE,I'm in! - 
12,42,156,MEOWTH,Yes! 
12,42,157,"JAMESILINA, [JAMES]",We're golden! 
12,42,158,MEOWTH,Bling! 
12,42,159,DAWN,Thank goodness! 
12,42,160,ASH,"You're in, Dawn! "
12,42,161,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] - 
12,42,162,BROCK,Piplup knew all along! - 
12,42,163,KHOURY,Congratulations! 
12,42,164,LYRA,"Dane, you were simply amazing! "
12,42,165,DAWN,"But, the real contest starts now! I'm counting on you Mamoswine! "
12,42,166,BROCK,So it's Mamoswine's stage debut! 
12,42,167,ASH,Can't wait to see it! 
12,42,168,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
12,42,169,LYRA,"I just realized this is your chance to win your fifth and final ribbon so it's a really important contest for - you, right Dane? - "
12,42,170,DAWN,Yeah! 
12,42,171,LYRA,"Then, why didn't you choose Piplup and Buneary? You're quite the daredevil, aren't you? "
12,42,172,DAWN,"No need to worry! I'm fine! No reason I should do anything differently at this point! Far as I'm concerned, it's battling as usual! "
12,42,173,MARIAN,"And now, it's time for the Battle Stage! With just five minutes on the clock, Coordinators must land their att*cks as stylishly as possible, while lowering their opponent's points in the process! So enjoy the dazzling display of moves! "
12,42,174,KHOURY,So round two is a battle round! 
12,42,175,BROCK,"But unlike a Gym battle, Coordinators and Pokémon are judged on the style of their moves and the way they're able to dodge their opponent's att*cks! "
12,42,176,MARIAN,"Let's meet the Coordinators for our first match! To my left, it's Dawn! To my right, Mario! We've got five minutes on the clock and begin! "
12,42,177,DAWN,"Mamoswine, spot light! "
12,42,178,MAMOSWINE,[APPEARING] 
12,42,179,MARIO,"Now, Granbull, go! "
12,42,180,GRANBULL,[APPEARING] 
12,42,181,MARIO,"Granbull, use Fire Fang, now! "
12,42,182,MARIAN,And Granbull unleashes a powerfully flaming Fire Fang! 
12,42,183,LYRA,Wait. How come Dane's points just went down?! 
12,42,184,BROCK,"In a Pokémon Contest battle, the successful use of a flashy move can lower your opponent's points! "
12,42,185,KHOURY,I see. That's amazing - Only in contest battles! 
12,42,186,DAWN,"Quick, dodge it and use Ice Shard! "
12,42,187,MARIAN,And Fire Fang misses! 
12,42,188,MAMOSWINE,[DETERMINED] / [ICE SHARD MOVE] 
12,42,189,MARIAN,"After a quick dodge, Mamoswine unleashes Ice Shard! "
12,42,190,DAWN,Let her rip! 
12,42,191,"MARIO, GRANBULL",[SHOCKED] 
12,42,192,MARIAN,Mamoswine has just eaten its own Ice Shard! 
12,42,193,ASH,"Go for it, Mamoswine! "
12,42,194,"PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[CHEERING][CHEERING] 
12,42,195,MAMOSWINE,[DETERMINED] / [EXERTION] 
12,42,196,MARIAN,Unbelievable! Mamoswine's fur has just frozen over and its body is covered in icicles! It's as if Mamoswine were wearing ice armor! 
12,42,197,LYRA,That did it! Look how their opponent's points went down! 
12,42,198,MAMOSWINE,[EXCITED] / [DETERMINED] 
12,42,199,DAWN,"We're on a roll, Mamoswine! All - right! Now Hidden Power! "
12,42,200,MARIAN,And Hidden Power makes Mamoswine's ice armor sparkle brilliantly! 
12,42,201,LYRA,That's beautiful! 
12,42,202,PIPLUP,[AMAZED] 
12,42,203,BROCK,"Yeah, and by combining those moves, Dawn's making Mamoswine look even more fearsome! "
12,42,204,DAWN,Take Down! 
12,42,205,MARIO,Uh oh! Dodge it! 
12,42,206,MAMOSWINE,[TAKE DOWN MOVE] 
12,42,207,MARIO,Granbull! 
12,42,208,MARIAN,That's it! And the team of Dawn and Mamoswine moves on to the semi - finals! 
12,42,209,MAMOSWINE,[PROUD] 
12,42,210,DAWN,Wait - That's it? The battle's over? 
12,42,211,MARIAN,"Using a triple combination move of Ice Shard, Hidden Power and Take Down, Mamoswine masterfully takes the match! "
12,42,212,DAWN,Man... That was a let down. 
12,42,213,LYRA,"Let down? But Dane, in case you didn't notice, Mamoswine won! "
12,42,214,BROCK,"Mamoswine was into it but that was only in the beginning of the Battle. And since it was actually won with Take Down alone, I'll bet Dawn wishes she could have done more! "
12,42,215,DAWN,Brock's right. It's true! There were a lot more things I wanted to try... 
12,42,216,LYRA,"But a win is a win, right? "
12,42,217,ASH,"Yeah, but I think Dawn wishes she had won the battle in a different kind of way. "
12,42,218,KHOURY,Contest battles are more complicated than I thought! 
12,42,219,DAWN,Yes! So I'll just make the semi -final battle flashier! 
12,42,220,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
12,42,221,MARIAN,"Folks, it's been one stylish contest battle after another and your applause shows me how much you love it! The first semi-final match will be between Dawn on my left and Jessilina on my right! And with Dawn having won four ribbons and Jessilina having won two, who will win the contest battle and move on to the final round? "
12,42,222,JESSIE,"It's all up to you, James! "
12,42,223,MARIAN,We've got five minutes on the clock! Begin! 
12,42,224,DAWN,"Mamoswine, spot light! "
12,42,225,MAMOSWINE,[APPEARING] 
12,42,226,"JAMESILINA, [JAMES]","Carnivine, show time! "
12,42,227,"JAMESILINA, [JAMES]","Not chow time, show time! "
12,42,228,MARIAN,"And once again, Jessilina puts everything into her performance! "
12,42,229,DAWN,"Mamoswine, Ice Shard! "
12,42,230,MAMOSWINE,[ICE SHARD MOVE] 
12,42,231,MARIAN,And Mamoswine's using Ice Shard! We'll see if it uses that power - up again! 
12,42,232,"JAMESILINA, [JAMES]",Use Vine Whip! 
12,42,233,MAMOSWINE,[ICE SHARD MOVE] / [SHOCKED] 
12,42,234,MARIAN,Mamoswine's power - up fails! 
12,42,235,PIKACHU,[SHOCKED] 
12,42,236,PIPLUP,[SHOCKED] 
12,42,237,LYRA,No way! 
12,42,238,MARIAN,And Carnivine's quick - moving Vine Whip has stolenMamoswine's Ice Shard! 
12,42,239,JESSIE,Now there's a slick trick! 
12,42,240,MEOWTH,That jazzy James...! Does this mean we might pull this baby off?! 
12,42,241,MAMOSWINE,[ANGRY] 
12,42,242,"JAMESILINA, [JAMES]",Return that Ice Shard to sender! 
12,42,243,CARNIVINE,[EXERTION] 
12,42,244,DAWN,"Mamoswine, dodge it! "
12,42,245,MAMOSWINE,[STARTLED] / [PAINED] 
12,42,246,MARIAN,And Mamoswine gets pummeled by its own Ice Shard! 
12,42,247,MAMOSWINE,[ANGRY] 
12,42,248,MARIAN,Well! It appears Mamoswine is getting all fired up! 
12,42,249,DAWN,"Please, Mamoswine, calm down! "
12,42,250,DAWN,"Wait, Mamoswine! "
12,42,251,BROCK,Mamoswine making a move without Dawn's command is bad news! 
12,42,252,ASH,"Mamoswine, chill out! "
12,42,253,PIKACHU,[WORRIED] 
12,42,254,MAMOSWINE,[TAKE DOWN MOVE] 
12,42,255,"JAMESILINA, [JAMES]",Jump and dodge it! 
12,42,256,MARIAN,Carnivine elegantly dodges - over and over while Mamoswine is getting more and more upset! 
12,42,257,DAWN,Mamoswine! Watch your opponent's move please! 
12,42,258,"JAMESILINA, [JAMES]",Carnivine now twirl and dance! Keep them in a tipsy trance! They don't stand a chance! 
12,42,259,MEOWTH,Yeah! Show those yahoos who wears the pants! 
12,42,260,CARNVINE,[PROUD] / [EXERTION] 
12,42,261,MAMOSWINE,[ANGRY] 
12,42,262,DAWN,Mamoswine! You've got to calm down! 
12,42,263,LYRA,It's like Mamoswine can't hear Dane talking! 
12,42,264,KHOURY,"Even with my untrained eye, I can tell Mamoswine's moves aren't normal! I'm afraid Carnivine's totally in control! "
12,42,265,DAWN,Don't att*ck unless I tell you to! 
12,42,266,MAMOSWINE,[HIDDEN POWER MOVE] 
12,42,267,"JAMESILINA, [JAMES]","Carnivine, b*llet Seed! "
12,42,268,CARNIVINE,[b*llet SEED MOVE] 
12,42,269,MAMOSWINE,[ANCIENT POWER MOVE] 
12,42,270,CARNIVINE,[EXERTION] 
12,42,271,DAWN,"Mamoswine, you've got to listen to me! Mamoswine stop! "
12,42,272,"JAMESILINA, [JAMES]","Carnivine, use Vine Whip to grab Mamoswine's tusks! "
12,42,273,CARNIVINE,[VINE WHIP MOVE] 
12,42,274,MAMOSWINE,[SHOCKED] 
12,42,275,"JAMESILINA, [JAMES]",And now......Pull back! 
12,42,276,CARNIVINE,[EXERTION] - 
12,42,277,DAWN,Mamoswine! - 
12,42,278,MEOWTH,Yeah! 
12,42,279,PIPLUP,[PANICKED] 
12,42,280,PIKACHU,[CHEERING] 
12,42,281,ASH,"C'mon Mamoswine, get a grip! "
12,42,282,LYRA,I - can't watch anymore! 
12,42,283,MAMOSWINE,[STRUGGLING] [PAINED] 
12,42,284,DAWN,Mamoswine! 
12,42,285,MAMOSWINE,[STRUGGLING] 
12,42,286,MARIAN,"All right, time's up! And the team moving on to the final round is... Jessilina, and Carnivine! "
12,42,287,"JAMESILINA, [JAMES]","Carnivine, we're in! "
12,42,288,CARNIVINE,[EXCITED] 
12,42,289,"JAMESILINA, [JAMES]","I love you too, but I still need to use my head! "
12,42,290,"JESSIE, MEOWTH",Eureka! 
12,42,291,MAMOSWINE,[DISAPPOINTED] 
12,42,292,DAWN,"Cheer up, Mamoswine. Come on...There's next time! And when that time comes, we'll be in better synch, right? "

12,42,299,CYNDAQUIL,[WORRIED] 
12,42,300,DAWN,Hey! No need to worry! 
12,42,301,LYRA,Maybe you should have used Piplup and another Pokémon after all. 
12,42,302,DAWN,"You might be right, but there are a lot of things youdon't know until you're actually up on stage! One thing's for sure, Ash, I know what Mamoswine and I have to work on after today you know? Hope you're okay with being our practice buddy some more. "
12,42,303,ASH,Sure! 
12,42,304,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
12,42,305,LYRA,"Dane, you lost but you're so positive in spite of it! "
12,42,306,MARIAN,Tyrogue has run out of points! So the final stage winner and Lilypad champion is Jessilina! 
12,42,307,LYRA,"Jessilina?! Wow, she really won! "
12,42,308,MARIAN,And now! Mr. Contesta will present Jessilina with the Lilypad Ribbon!

12,42,315,MEOWTH,This Jess was worth the wait! 
12,42,316,JESSIE,One minute... 
12,42,317,JESSIE,I'm not pleased that you as me got more applause than I as me. So what do you have to say for yourselves? 
12,42,318,JAMES,"I say - dumb luck, perhaps? "
12,42,319,MEOWTH,James is a dummy all right! 
12,42,320,JESSIE,Well I want to be adored like that too! I'll never get sick again!

12,41,8,KHOURY,Brock is amazing! What a memory! 
12,41,9,DAWN,Yeah.But I think that memory would be put to better use as a Pokémon Breeder! 
12,41,10,BROCK,"Nurse Joy, I suggest continuing this over dinner for two...Nice table, soft music, candlelight. "
12,41,11,CROAGUNK,[ATTACKING] 
12,41,12,BROCK,Maybe - I'll just - STAND! 
12,41,13,JOY,Oh.Oh!

12,41,26,ASH,"Well, if it's a rogue Pokémon, I bet it's a strong Pokémon! "
12,41,27,LYRA,Hey! How about we have a look? 
12,41,28,KHOURY,Wait! Isn't that dangerous? 
12,41,29,LYRA,Khoury! Do you have to be afraid of everything?! 
12,41,30,ASH,Okay! It's time to catch a rogue Pokémon! 
12,41,31,PIKACHU,[EXCITED]

12,41,52,GIBLE,[AMUSED] 
12,41,53,POKEDEX [MALE],"Gible. The Land Shark Pokémon. Gible once lived in the tropics, and to avoid cold it lives in caves warmed by geothermal heat. "

12,41,74,ASH,You're on! - 
12,41,75,KHOURY,"Right, Ash! "
12,41,76,JESSIE,Impressive comes to mind with that Gible! 
12,41,77,MEOWTH,My take is we gift it to the Boss before those Twerps know what end's up! 
12,41,78,JAMES,But will it meet with his approving seal? 
12,41,79,MEOWTH,"Duh! Look, the Boss works his lapels off every day, right? "
12,41,80,MEOWTH,"And like any fearless leader, he's always got to look cool, calm and at his collected best! "
12,41,81,MEOWTH,But even Bosses have to kick back once in a while - you know - to find his inner Boss! 
12,41,82,MEOWTH,"'Course t n groovy hard and having fun! Playing gobs and games under the summer sun! Then what'll you think the Boss's going to say, eh? Thanks to this Gible, I feel like I'm returning back to my youth! I think some serious rewards are in order for Meowth and his friends - so for them too, the fun will never end! "
12,41,83,MEOWTH,And that means. 
12,41,84,JESSIE,The search for our inner Bosses is over - Now that we're rich!

12,41,110,LYRA,You can say that again! 
12,41,111,PIKACHU,[ANNOYED] 
12,41,112,DAWN,It looks like Ash and Lyra are having a rough time.

12,41,129,LYRA,What do you mean chase? Now I get it! 
12,41,130,ASH,"Buizel! When we chase it your way, you battle! Okay? "
12,41,131,BUIZEL,[AFFIRMATIVE]

12,41,164,PIPLUP,[SHEEPISH] 
12,41,165,ASH,I guess this really wasn't such a bad idea after all. 
12,41,166,LYRA,I'd say there's a much better chance of this working! 
12,41,167,KHOURY,That's right! And maybe if I add the flavors that Ground - types and Dragon - types like in their Pokémon food. 
12,41,168,LYRA,"But, I thought you said Totodile didn't like the Pokémon - food you made, Khoury. - "
12,41,169,KHOURY,"Give me a break, Lyra! After all, I've learned a lot about cooking from Brock! Okay, it's ready! You guys are welcome to it, too! - "

12,41,211,MEOWTH,Go knit a sweater with your yarn! 
12,41,212,JESSIE,"If we view it, we catch it! What's more.There's a boat built for four! - "

12,41,243,LYRA,Do Khoury and I act like that? 
12,41,244,ASH,"Wow, this is a big cave. "
12,41,245,LYRA,"So do you really think Gible is in here, Khoury? "
12,41,246,KHOURY,I can almost guarantee it! My Pokédex says that Gible really like to live in caves.

12,39,130,CHIKORITA,[APPEARING] / [EXCITED]

12,39,147,LYRA,"All right, this is really a duel between two Trainers' starting Pokémon from Johto and Sinnoh. In the match of the century! "
12,39,148,BROCK,Chikorita's got the advantage being a Grass type. 
12,39,149,KHOURY'S FATHER,It's the battle between Piplup and Chikorita Begin! 
12,39,150,LYRA,Now Chikorita Razor Leaf!

12,39,164,DAWN,That's what I'm talking about! 
12,39,165,KHOURY,Peck is a Flying-type att*ck so it's super effective against a Grass-type Pokémon like Chikorita! 
12,39,166,DAWN,Okay Bubble Beam once more! 
12,39,167,PIPLUP,[BUBBLE BEAM MOVE] 
12,39,168,LYRA,"Now, Light Screen quick! "

12,39,174,CHIKORITA,[DAZED] 
12,39,175,KHOURY'S FATHER,Chikorita is unable to battle and the victory goes to Piplup! Which makes Dawn our big winner! 
12,39,176,DAWN,We did it! 
12,39,177,BROCK,"That Light Screen might have held up against Bubble Beam, but it was no match against Piplup's Peck. "
12,39,178,KHOURY,Looks like Dawn's strategy worked! I'm impressed! 
12,39,179,LYRA,"I guess my judgment was a little off Chikorita, and I'm really sorry! But you still did a great job! "
12,39,180,DAWN,"Piplup, nice work! "
12,39,181,PIPLUP,[PROUD]

12,37,5,PALMER,It's what you've waited for Twinleaf Town. Because Palmer... 
12,37,6,PALMER,has returned! 
12,37,7,PALMER,Dragonite go! 
12,37,8,DRAGONITE,[EXCITED] 
12,37,9,ASH,Dragonite? That's what I call cool! 
12,37,10,BROCK,Hey who's that? 
12,37,11,BARRY,"Looks like someone's a bit slow on the uptake, because that's none other than Palmer, my dad! "
12,37,12,BROCK,Your dad? 
12,37,13,PERSON A,"Wow, look at how big Dragonite's gotten! "
12,37,14,PERSON B,I remember the days when those two were the tops of Twinleaf Town! 
12,37,15,ASH,Tops? 
12,37,16,ASH,"Wait! Palmer, I want to challenge you to a battle, now! "
12,37,17,PIKACHU,[EAGER] 
12,37,18,DAWN,"Look out, Ash! I challenge you, too! "
12,37,19,BARRY,"Hold the phone! If anyone's going to battle dad, it's going to be me! "
12,37,20,ASH,"Yeah, why's that? "
12,37,21,PIKACHU,[INDIGNANT] 
12,37,22,BARRY,"Whoa, you don't know? For your information, the winner of tomorrow's Battle Challenge will face off against my dad, Palmer! "
12,37,23,BARRY,"See, the fact is my dad is none other than one of the Frontier Brains in the Sinnoh Battle Frontier! "
12,37,24,BARRY,He runs the awesome Battle Tower arena! 
12,37,25,BARRY,Everybody calls him the Tower Tycoon! 
12,37,26,ASH,"Wow, so you're a Frontier Brain, huh? "
12,37,27,PIKACHU,[IMPRESSED] 
12,37,28,PALMER,Guilty as charged! That's correct! And tomorrow only one person will be battling against me! 
12,37,29,PALMER,I'm looking forward to it! 
12,37,30,ASH,All right! Looks like I'm going to be taking on a Frontier Brain! 
12,37,31,PIKACHU,[CONFIDENT] 
12,37,32,NARRATOR,"As the Twinleaf Festival rapidly draws to a close, the air is crackling with the anticipation of seeing just how a Frontier Brain battles! Sometimes it's hard to know, Which way you're supposed to go. But deep inside, you know you're strong. If you follow your heart, you can't be wrong. Stand up! [Stand up!] For what is right. Be brave! Get ready to fight. Hold on! [Hold on!] We're friends for life. And if we come, together as one, Complete the quest, that we've begun, We will win the battle! Galactic Battles! Pokémon! "
12,37,33,PIKACHU,[DELIGHTED] 
12,37,34,PIPLUP,[DELIGHTED] 
12,37,35,JOHANNA,"So did you get to meet Palmer, Dawn? "
12,37,36,DAWN,I never realized Barry had such an impressive dad! 
12,37,37,DAWN,"Hey, and Ash, isn't it totally exciting to think either one of us might actually get to battle with him tomorrow? "
12,37,38,ASH,"Yeah, it's going to be either you or me! "
12,37,39,DAWN,You're going down! 
12,37,40,BROCK,"I'm entering, too! "
12,37,41,ASH,"Whoa, you are? "
12,37,42,BROCK,Why not? Now keep in mind after all this is a festival. What do you say Croagu- 
12,37,43,BROCK,unk? 
12,37,44,JOHANNA,"All right, eat up, everyone! You'll need your strength tomorrow! "
12,37,45,"ASH, DAWN, BROCK",Thank you!

12,37,47,JOHANNA,"Since today is the final day of the Twinleaf Festival, I have but one request for each and every one of you to get in there and give it all you've got! "
12,37,48,"GLAMEOW, UMBREON",[EXCITED] 
12,37,49,DAWN,Wow! Mom's the coolest! 
12,37,50,PIPLUP,[IMPRESSED] 
12,37,51,ASH,No doubt she was a top coordinator! 
12,37,52,PIKACHU,[IMPRESSED] 
12,37,53,BROCK,Yeah! She's something all right... 
12,37,54,JOHANNA,"I'm proud to say, thanks to you, our festival's been a rousing success! So on behalf of my fellow event planners, I'd like to thank you all! "
12,37,55,IZZY,"Johanna's the definition of the word ""nice!"" "
12,37,56,CARA,Yup! She's a sweetheart all right... 
12,37,57,JOHANNA,"And now! Ladies and Gentlemen, it's time for the last event that I'm sure you've all been excitedly anticipating! Introducing our very special guest, the one and only Tower Tycoon Palmer! "
12,37,58,JOHANNA,Palmer? 
12,37,59,JOHANNA,Palmer? 
12,37,60,PALMER,Great! 
12,37,61,PALMER,They're sublime! Incredible! I'll take them all! 
12,37,62,JAMES,Yay! Hard work can pay off! 
12,37,63,MEOWTH,Nothing like sweet nothings from a Tycoon! 
12,37,64,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
12,37,65,MIME JR.,[MIMICKING] 
12,37,66,ASH,"Hey, Palmer? "
12,37,67,DAWN,Where are you? 
12,37,68,PIKACHU,[URGENT] 
12,37,69,ASH,There you are! 
12,37,70,BARRY,"Hey, dad! "
12,37,71,PALMER,Oh! Is something wrong? 
12,37,72,BARRY,Come on! 
12,37,73,PALMER,Wait! Here! Just try these Octillery snacks. They're great! 
12,37,74,BROCK,This isn't a great time to eat! 
12,37,75,DAWN,You sure your father's a real champion? 
12,37,76,BARRY,"Believe it or not, yes! "
12,37,77,BARRY,[SURPRISED] 
12,37,78,JOHANNA,"Palmer, please kindly report to the battle area a.s.a.p! The Battle Challenge is starting! "
12,37,79,PALMER,Now how could I have forgotten? I blew it this time! Here! A little gift for you! 
12,37,80,ASH,"Uh, thanks! "
12,37,81,PALMER,Best Octillery snacks ever! Keep up the good work! 
12,37,82,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH","Aye-aye, sir! "
12,37,83,BARRY,Let's book! 
12,37,84,"PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[URGENT] 
12,37,85,JAMES,A Top Tycoon coo! 
12,37,86,MEOWTH,Wahoo! We'll make sacks of them snacks! 
12,37,87,JESSIE,Snack specialists! 
12,37,88,JAMES,Which will fill their tummies and our wallets! 
12,37,89,MIME JR.,[EXCITED] 
12,37,90,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
12,37,91,JOHANNA,"And now, what you've all been waiting for! "
12,37,92,JOHANNA,"Because it really is the time for you to join me in welcoming a real Sinnoh Battle Frontier Brain! The Battle Tower Battle Tycoon, you know him, you love him, Palmer! "
12,37,93,JOHANNA,"We're so honored that you agreed to join us in today's exciting Twinleaf Festival event, thanks! "
12,37,94,PALMER,"The Twinleaf Festival is a great tradition, and so, the honor is mine! "
12,37,95,PALMER,"For today, the great Twinleaf Town is home to the Battle Tower! "
12,37,96,DAWN,Whoa! Look at him work the crowd! 
12,37,97,BROCK,"If you ask me, I'd guess it's all part of being a Frontier Brain! "
12,37,98,JOHANNA,"And now, let's go over the simple Battle Challenge rules! "
12,37,99,JOHANNA,The competition is open to all who consider themselves Trainers! 
12,37,100,JOHANNA,"Our event will be conducted in tournament format, and whoever emerges victorious will have the honor of facing off against Palmer! "
12,37,101,ASH,"Oh man, I'm getting psyched! That battle against Palmer is as good as mine! "
12,37,102,BARRY,"Yeah, dream on Ash! When it comes to winning, it's Barry all the way! "
12,37,103,DAWN,"All right, you two! You may be rivals but don't you count us out! "
12,37,104,PIPLUP,[INDIGNANT] 
12,37,105,BROCK,"Us, either! "
12,37,106,HAPPINY,[EXCITED] 
12,37,107,JOHANNA,"And in addition to the privilege of battling Palmer, the winner of this challenge will be presented with this: "
12,37,108,JOHANNA,the beautiful gold trophy crafted right here in Twinleaf Town! 
12,37,109,PALMER,All right then. We'll soon know whom this trophy will belong to. And may the very best challenger win! 
12,37,110,JOHANNA,"Now, please allow me to introduce our judge: helping with the festival from the start. Say hello to Mr. Sayer! "
12,37,111,JESSIE,Sayer! Who knew? 
12,37,112,JAMES,Then he doesn't just judge us! 
12,37,113,MEOWTH,Guess if you got it spread it around! 
12,37,114,WOBBUFFET,[SURPRISED] 
12,37,115,JOHANNA,"All right, let's get the fun times started! Prepare for the Twinleaf Town edition of the Battle Tower! "
12,37,116,DAWN,I lost! Somebody's really going to get fined! 
12,37,117,PIPLUP,[PLAYFUL] 
12,37,118,BARRY,"Oh funny! Look, I was supposed to be challenging my dad! Ash, it's fine time! "
12,37,119,JOHANNA,And the winner of today's Challenge is Ash Ketchum! So let's give a big round of applause to Ash... here all the way from Pallet Town in Kanto! Sinnoh League Challenger Ash! 
12,37,120,ASH,Thank you! Thanks a lot everybody! 
12,37,121,JESSIE,I'll be! The Twerp got lucky again 
12,37,122,JAMES,Not luck... he slayed them! 
12,37,123,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
12,37,124,MEOWTH,Knock off the commentary and start snack hawking! 
12,37,125,JOHANNA,"Okay! As you all know, this is only the beginning for Ash as he prepares for a new challenge! So now let's hear a word from his next opponent, Tower Tycoon Palmer! "
12,37,126,PALMER,"This Battle marks the Twinleaf Festival's end! Soon Ash, you'll show me just what you're made of! "
12,37,127,ASH,You bet! So don't go easy on me Palmer! 
12,37,128,PALMER,"Don't worry! Now, Rhyperior... go! "
12,37,129,RHYPERIOR,[CHALLENGING] 
12,37,130,ASH,That Pokémon's huge! 
12,37,131,PIKACHU,[INCREDULOUS] 
12,37,132,BARRY,"Whoa, there it is! "
12,37,133,BARRY,Rhyperior! 
12,37,134,POKEDEX,"Rhyperior. The Drill Pokémon, and the evolved form of Rhydon. Rhyperior can concentrate strength in its body and expand, causing the stone in its hand to launch. "
12,37,135,PALMER,"Never have I met a match for my Rhyperior, as Battle Tower challengers fall in defeat! "
12,37,136,PALMER,"Now, you shall experience its strength! "
12,37,137,ASH,"Okay, Rhyperior's a Ground and a Rock-type, and both types weigh a lot! That's got to mean speed would be important to b*at it. But so far all the other Gym Leaders I've challenged have been ready to take on challengers that know about their weak points... "
12,37,138,ASH,Palmer's got to have a strategy to handle quick opponents... 
12,37,139,ASH,"So I'm going to mix things up like this! Grotle, I choose you! "
12,37,140,GROTLE,[EXCITED] 
12,37,141,ASH,Grotle you can do this! There's no way that Rhyperior's going to be as strong as you are! 
12,37,142,DAWN,I thought Buizel would've been his first choice 
12,37,143,PIPLUP,[SURPRISED] 
12,37,144,BROCK,"Well, I sure didn't see brawn against brawn in the cards! "
12,37,145,BARRY,"Man, what's Ash doing? The last thing he should do is underestimate dad's Rhyperior! "
12,37,146,SAYER,The one-on-one battle between Palmer and Ash from Pallet Town will now begin! 
12,37,147,SAYER,Neither side will be allowed to exchange Pokémon! 
12,37,148,SAYER,First move goes to the challenger! 
12,37,149,SAYER,"All right then, battle begin! "
12,37,150,ASH,"Now, Grotle. Energy Ball, let's go! "
12,37,151,GROTLE,[ENERGY BALL MOVE] 
12,37,152,JOHANNA,And it's a direct hit by Grotle! 
12,37,153,GROTLE,[PLEASED] 
12,37,154,ASH,Yes! 
12,37,155,JOHANNA,It did nothing! Rhyperior looks fine! 
12,37,156,GROTLE,[SHOCKED] 
12,37,157,ASH,What the... 
12,37,158,DAWN,"Rhyperior's a Ground and Rock-type Pokémon, so Grotle's att*cks should work really well. I don't understand it! "
12,37,159,BARRY,Then listen up! Rhyperior's Solid Rock Ability! It limits the damage caused by any att*cks it's weak against! 
12,37,160,PALMER,Ash that's quite an Energy Ball Grotle's got there which shows me that you've clearly raised your Pokémon well! 
12,37,161,PALMER,That said... to Rhyperior it was little more than a cool breeze! 
12,37,162,GROTLE,[FIERCE] 
12,37,163,PALMER,"All right, let's really get things moving with Rock Polish! "
12,37,164,RHYPERIOR,[ROCK POLISH MOVE] 
12,37,165,ASH,"Grotle, Razor Leaf! "
12,37,166,GROTLE,[RAZOR LEAF MOVE] 
12,37,167,RHYPERIOR,[EXERTION] 
12,37,168,PIKACHU,[SHOCKED] 
12,37,169,ASH,How'd Rhyperior move so fast? 
12,37,170,BROCK,"Since Rock Polish increases a Pokémon's speed, things aren't really looking all that good for Grotle right now. "
12,37,171,BARRY,"Told you! Don't underestimate Dad's Rhyperior, okay? "
12,37,172,PALMER,"Sandstorm, go! "
12,37,173,RHYPERIOR,[AGGRESSIVE] 
12,37,174,RHYPERIOR,[SANDSTROM MOVE] 
12,37,175,GROTLE,[STRUGGLING] 
12,37,176,ASH,Hang on! 
12,37,177,PIKACHU,[ENCOURAGING] 
12,37,178,JOHANNA,"And Rhyperior's Sandstorm keeps on keeps on keeping on, as Grotle's surrounded by it! "
12,37,179,PALMER,"Rock Wrecker, now! "
12,37,180,RHYPERIOR,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
12,37,181,RHYPERIOR,[ROCK WRECKER MOVE] 
12,37,182,GROTLE,[PAINED] / [STRUGGLING] 
12,37,183,JAMES,The Twerp's getting tousled... 
12,37,184,MEOWTH,Octillery Snacks! 
12,37,185,JESSIE,Yeah. Rhyperior's hammering hard... 
12,37,186,MEOWTH,"If you two punks don't put a cork in that worthless chit chat and start selling snacks, I'll hammeryour tousles! "
12,37,187,WOBBUFFET,[FRUSTURATED AFFIRMATIVE] 
12,37,188,JOHANNA,And Rhyperior follows up on Rock Wrecker with another Sandstorm! 
12,37,189,JOHANNA,Things do not look good for Grotle! 
12,37,190,GROTLE,[STRUGGLING] 
12,37,191,ASH,"Quick, Synthesis! "
12,37,192,GROTLE,[SYNTHESIS MOVE] 
12,37,193,RHYPERIOR,[EXHAUSTED] 
12,37,194,PALMER,"Well, well. I see Ash's switching over to recovery mode... "
12,37,195,BROCK,"Smart move! Of course after f*ring Rock Wrecker, Rhyperior needs time before it can launch any more att*cks "
12,37,196,DAWN,"Which is time Ash can use to try and pull Grotle together, great! "
12,37,197,BARRY,Except I think Ash's forgetting about Sandstorm 
12,37,198,JOHANNA,And Rhyperior's Sandstorm won't stop! 
12,37,199,GROTLE,[SYNTHESIS MOVE] 
12,37,200,GROTLE,[EAGER] 
12,37,201,ASH,"You did it! Now use Razor Leaf, let's go! "
12,37,202,GROTLE,[RAZOR LEAF MOVE] 
12,37,203,BROCK,Wow! Grotle stopped the Sandstorm! 
12,37,204,DAWN,Yeah Grotle! Awesome move! 
12,37,205,BARRY,What's up with that? Is that even possible? 
12,37,206,RHYPERIOR,[FRUSTRATED] 
12,37,207,PALMER,Megahorn! 
12,37,208,RHYPERIOR,[MEGAHORN MOVE] 
12,37,209,DAWN,"Whoa, it's moving fast! "
12,37,210,BROCK,That's cause Rock Polish hasn't worn off! 
12,37,211,BARRY,Let's see Ash get out of this! 
12,37,212,ASH,Guess we'll have to get in their face! Okay Grotle! Use Energy Ball! 
12,37,213,GROTLE,[ENERGY BALL MOVE] 
12,37,214,RHYPERIOR,[CONFIDENT] 
12,37,215,ASH,Keep bringing Rhyperior close! 
12,37,216,RHYPERIOR,[INTENT] 
12,37,217,GROTLE,[CONCENTRATED] 
12,37,218,GROTLE,[NERVOUS]

12,37,220,GROTLE,[STRUGGLING] 
12,37,221,ASH,Uh oh! Our timing got totally off! 
12,37,222,RHYPERIOR,[SURPRISED] 
12,37,223,GROTLE,[SURPRISED] 
12,37,224,BARRY,Hey folks! What's happening out there? 
12,37,225,DAWN,And what's with that light? 
12,37,226,PIPLUP,[CONCERNED] 
12,37,227,PALMER,It can't be! 
12,37,228,PIKACHU,[SHOCKED] 
12,37,229,ASH,What's going on? 
12,37,230,GROTLE,[SHOCKED] 
12,37,231,JOHANNA,Amazing! It looks like Grotle has absorbed the power of the Energy Ball after it exploded in its mouth! 
12,37,232,ASH,Whoa. Hey wait! I didn't know Grotle could do that! 
12,37,233,BARRY,"Okay, so what I'm seeing is Grotle actually ate the Energy Ball? "
12,37,234,BROCK,It may have been bad timing but it sure led to some good results! 
12,37,235,DAWN,Awesome! And interesting too! 
12,37,236,BARRY,Did you say interesting? 
12,37,237,BROCK,Could be useful in future contests right? 
12,37,238,DAWN,You bet! So pay attention Piplup! 
12,37,239,PIPLUP,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
12,37,240,PALMER,"I'll tell you, I've been a Frontier Brain awhile I know guts, and you've got them, Ash! Rock Wrecker! "
12,37,241,RHYPERIOR,[ROCK WRECKER MOVE] 
12,37,242,ASH,"Okay...Grotle, now! Use Rock Climb! Let's go! "
12,37,243,GROTLE,[ENTHUSIASTIC] 
12,37,244,GROTLE,[ROCK CLIMB MOVE]

12,37,255,"GROTLE, RHYPERIOR",[INTENT] [OVERWHELMED] 
12,37,256,GROTLE,[DETERMINED]

12,37,258,DAWN,Way to go! 
12,37,259,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
12,37,260,BROCK,Yes! The power of Rock Climb combined with Energy Ball is definitely a force to be reckoned with! Excellent! 
12,37,261,BARRY,Wow! I can't believe it! Ash and Grotle are really something else! I'll fine them both! 
12,37,262,JOHANNA,Grotle's power is mind boggling indeed as Rhyperior loses ground by the second! 
12,37,263,RHYPERIOR,[ATTACKING] 
12,37,264,"RHYPERIOR, GROTLE",[STRUGGLING] 
12,37,265,MALE A,"Hang in, Grotle! "
12,37,266,MALE B,You can do it! 
12,37,267,MALE C,Yeah stay with it! 
12,37,268,ASH,"Hey Grotle, you got this! "
12,37,269,ASH,Rhyperior's Solid Rock's no match for you now! Take it down! 
12,37,270,PALMER,No one's ever battled Rhyperior this hard. Good thing I remembered to show up! Rhyperior! Use Rock Wrecker! 
12,37,271,RHYPERIOR,[ROCK WRECKER MOVE] 
12,37,272,PIKACHU,[SHOCKED] 
12,37,273,RHYPERIOR,[EXHAUSTED] 
12,37,274,GROTLE,[STUNNED] 
12,37,275,SAYER,Grotle is unable to battle which means Rhyperior gets the win! Victory... 
12,37,276,SAYER,goes to Palmer! 
12,37,277,ASH,Aww. Guess that's it... 
12,37,278,CARA,I'm not sure how I feel about this... 
12,37,279,IZZY,They battled hard. I'm okay. 
12,37,280,BARRY,"I knew dad would win! I mean, come on! As if Ash ever stood a chance in the first place! "
12,37,281,DAWN,And to think Ash was so close... 
12,37,282,PIPLUP,[SAD] 
12,37,283,BROCK,Although Ash seems to be handling it well! 
12,37,284,"DAWN, BARRY, PIPLUP",[SURPRISED] 
12,37,285,ASH,"Grotle, you were just awesome out there! "
12,37,286,PALMER,Our battle was really a lot of fun! That Energy Ball caught me off guard... 
12,37,287,ASH,"Well, to be totally honest... We're more surprised than you! "

12,37,289,PALMER,"At any rate, congratulations on winning the Battle Challenge! "
12,37,290,PALMER,I'm happy to present you with this!

12,37,297,ASH,Sure is! 
12,37,298,BARRY,"He raises his Pokémon with respect, which is why they're so strong and why he never loses or will lose a battle or a challenge ever! "
12,37,299,DAWN,My mom's just the same... 
12,37,300,DAWN,I thought about that when I saw her and Glameow together! I knew I wanted to be a coordinator just like my mom had been! 
12,37,301,BARRY,"Boy, do I relate! When your parents are strong it makes you want to be stronger! Works every time! "
12,37,302,ASH,Talking about raising Pokémon with respect sure takes me back... 
12,37,303,ASH,And I just keep wondering what makes Paul and his Pokémon as powerful as they are... 
12,37,304,BARRY,Hey! What's up? It's an annual tradition that I'm supposed to sing the last song with all of them too!

12,37,318,ASH,"Why, Sunyshore City? "
12,37,319,PALMER,"Because, with your battling skills I'm pretty sure you'll be able to give quite a shock to Sunyshore's Gym Leader! "

12,36,304,BARRY,"It wasn't a dream, was it? But things didn't seem right. "
12,36,305,PALMER,"You tell me if it was a dream or reality. See, it all depends on you. "
12,36,306,BARRY,"Dad, what do you mean? "
12,36,307,PALMER,"I mean the past creates the future. Depending on how hard you work in the present, that effort becomes your past, and that connects to your future! "
12,36,308,BARRY,Wish I knew what you were talking about. 
12,36,309,PALMER,"It is said that Xatu is a Pokémon that can see into both the past and the future. Your youth may have caused it to see vast possibilities, and so it decided to remind you of a few past events! "
12,36,310,DAWN,"Okay, let's see. Today, Piplup, you pulled me out of a big jam! "

12,35,2,JOHANNA,The Twinleaf Festival's almost here! And the first event is a Pokémon lecture by Professor Oak! 
12,35,3,BROCK,What a perfect way to start things off! Professor Oak is known as a Pokémon expert! 
12,35,4,BROCK,His reputation is worldwide! Everyone loves him! 
12,35,5,DAWN,Piplup! We'll see him in person! 
12,35,6,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
12,35,7,ASH,How about letting us help you out with more stuff? 
12,35,8,PIKACHU,[EAGER]

Galactic Battles! Pokémon! "
12,35,11,CARA,"Dear me, I hope he gets here soon. "
12,35,12,IZZY,This is peculiar. 
12,35,13,IZZY,His balloon should have already landed quite a long while ago. 
12,35,14,JOHANNA,Excuse me. Is there a problem? 
12,35,15,JOHANNA,Where's Professor Oak? 
12,35,16,IZZY,I'm afraid he hasn't arrived yet. 
12,35,17,CARA,Maybe something went wrong en route! 
12,35,18,JOHANNA,But his lecture's about to start. This is not good! 
12,35,19,ASH,We'll go check things out! 
12,35,20,JOHANNA,That would be great. 
12,35,21,ASH,"Pikachu, let's go! "

12,35,28,JAMES,"The jury's out on the ""good"" part. "
12,35,29,JESSIE,"Oak merchandise will be a goldmine! Peanuts, popcorn balls, and cookies! "
12,35,30,MEOWTH,Peeps are going to buy that junk? 
12,35,31,JESSIE,If the real Professor Oak sells it! 
12,35,32,JAMES,He's out of our price range. 
12,35,33,JESSIE,Don't you worry! 
12,35,34,MEOWTH,The three scariest words I know! 
12,35,35,FAKE OAK [JAMES],Me? Oak? 
12,35,36,MEOWTH,The only thing missing now is a poem! 
12,35,37,JESSIE,"I'm good, all right. "
12,35,38,JESSIE,"And, if it fooled you. just think of the naive public! "
12,35,39,CARA,Dear me! 
12,35,40,CARA,Now what in the world are you doing out here? 
12,35,41,IZZY,Professor Oak! JAMES But. I'm not.

12,35,47,MEOWTH,"If Sayer gets wind of this, we're toast! "
12,35,48,JESSIE,I suggest a little exercise! 
12,35,49,JAMES,All alone with precious little more than an alter ego! 
12,35,50,CARA,"Good news, Johanna! "
12,35,51,CARA,Our special guest has finally arrived! 
12,35,52,JOHANNA,Great! We were so worried! 
12,35,53,JAMES,You've got nothing on me! 
12,35,54,JOHANNA,Hmm. 
12,35,55,JAMES,The jig is up! My tenure is terminated! 
12,35,56,JOHANNA,"Guess what they say about videophones is true. You do look much younger in person, you know! "
12,35,57,JAMES,The game continues! 
12,35,58,JOHANNA,We'll be starting soon! Thanks again for your help! 
12,35,59,JAMES,My pleasure! 
12,35,60,DRIVER,"Sincerest apologies, Professor Oak! "
12,35,61,DRIVER,It will only take a minute to change the tire. 
12,35,62,DRIVER,"Until then, please relax! "
12,35,63,PROFESSOR OAK,Now there's a sight! 
12,35,64,PROFESSOR OAK,"A most impressive-looking marshland, to be sure! "
12,35,65,PROFESSOR OAK,And I'll wager it's the home of some exciting Pokémon! 
12,35,66,DRIVER,"Professor, please! Since we're late, it's best if you don't go far. "
12,35,67,PROFESSOR OAK,I'll be right back! I'm just going to have a quick look! 
12,35,68,DRIVER,I hope. 
12,35,69,ASH,What the. 
12,35,70,ASH,"Excuse me, was that Professor Oak? "
12,35,71,DRIVER,Yes! He went off to look for some Pokémon! 
12,35,72,BROCK,"Well, that's Professor Oak, all right! "
12,35,73,ASH,"But, guys, his lecture's about to start soon! "
12,35,74,DAWN,"Oh, no! Worse than that, I've been hearing rumors that that marshland is chock full of quicksand! "
12,35,75,ASH,No time to waste! We've got to bring him back! 
12,35,76,JAMES,"If I don't extricate myself from this fiasco, I'm doomed! "
12,35,77,IZZY,This is the nicest turnout I've ever witnessed! 
12,35,78,CARA,For once I agree! Thanks of course to Professor Oak! 
12,35,79,JOHANNA,"So, Professor, I understand you're going to be speaking about ""The Interrelation of Pokémon and Evolutionary Stones,"" right? "
12,35,80,JOHANNA,Hello? 
12,35,81,JAMES,Isn't that special! Run that by me again? 
12,35,82,MEOWTH,You think he's actually going through with it? 
12,35,83,JESSIE,Could be. though running has served him well in the past.

12,35,239,PROFESSOR OAK,Of course it is! It's me who should be asking you that! 
12,35,240,BROCK,"We were very worried about you, sir! "
12,35,241,PROFESSOR OAK,"No need for that! Why, these Pokémon are as nice as nice can be. "
12,35,242,ASH,So why'd they bring you here? 
12,35,243,PROFESSOR OAK,I believe it has something to do with Lombre. 
12,35,244,ASH,"Whoa, a Lombre, huh? "
12,35,245,POKEDEX,"Lombre. The Jolly Pokémon. Lombre is a playful trickster. If it spots an angler, it will tug on the fishing line to interfere. "

12,35,251,ASH,Not by a long sh*t! 
12,35,252,PROFESSOR OAK,I would agree. At least it's supposed to be. Something's off. 
12,35,253,POLITOED,[INSISTENT] 
12,35,254,PROFESSOR OAK,It appears Politoed would like me to do something to lift its spirits! 
12,35,255,DAWN,"That's amazing! How can you always understand what Pokémon are feeling, Professor? "
12,35,256,PROFESSOR OAK,"Why, it's nothing you can't do! Open your heart! Join it with a Pokémon's heart, and you're there! "
12,35,257,ASH,"That's why he's the professor, right? "
12,35,258,PIPLUP,[IMPRESSED]

12,35,260,PROFESSOR OAK,And in fact. I believe what really happened is that Politoed smelled something I was carrying.

12,35,262,DAWN,That's a Water Stone? 
12,35,263,PROFESSOR OAK,Correct! It can be used to initiate a Lombre's Evolution! 
12,35,264,ASH,Amazing! 
12,35,265,PROFESSOR OAK,"The fact is, Politoed's the leader of the marshland. and seems to want to coax this timid Lombre into evolving! "
12,35,266,PROFESSOR OAK,I brought it since my lecture concerns the connection between Pokémon Evolution and stones. but.

12,35,294,IZZY,I don't recall the contract stating we were to get two professors!

12,35,314,BOY,So I figure the real Professor Oak should be able to figure out why that is. 
12,35,315,PROFESSOR OAK,I'm happy to help! Let's have a look at your Tyranitar. 
12,35,316,BOY,"Tyranitar, come on out! "
12,35,317,TYRANITAR,[AGGRESSIVE]

12,34,99,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH","Yes, Sayer, sir! "
12,34,100,MEOWTH,Why do we always get to be the festival Goldeen grabber g*ons in the first place? 
12,34,101,JAMES,"Let us not forget that festival employment is employment nonetheless, and if we don't start filling the Team Rocket pocketbook, our operations will soon be kaput, and we'll be out of a job! "
12,34,102,JESSIE,Perish the thought! So here's to us keeping Team Rocket afloat! 
12,34,103,MEOWTH,And here's to patching up the old leaky Team Rocket boat...

12,34,114,BROCK,"Well, my dream is to become the world's best Pokémon breeder, so I appreciate the kind words... "
12,34,115,JOHANNA,"And you will be, I'm sure! "
12,34,116,BROCK,"Wow, you think? Thank you. That's so nice! "
12,34,117,NOELLE,"Brock, it would be wonderful if you'd give me your Pokémon food recipe... "
12,34,118,BROCK,"Me? Absolutely, Noelle. but wait, there's more! If you act now, I'll also reveal to you my secret recipe of love, chock full of sugar, spice, and everything nice! It's a recipe that comes straight from my heart, and we'll make it together as we first cook over high heat and then let it simmer... Flame off...again! "

12,34,122,ASH,"Right! See, I'm going to be training here in Twinleaf Town for awhile! "
12,34,123,PROFESSOR OAK,"Remember, Ash, Johanna is very talented and was a Top Coordinator in her day! I'm sure there's a lot you can learn from her. Training here, training there, means training well anywhere! My point being, the best way to train and learn about Pokémon is wherever you are, and to have fun doing it! "
12,34,124,DAWN,That's amazing! The poetry man even gives you great advice wrapped up in a poem! 
12,34,125,JOHANNA,"Now, now, Dawn, it's impolite to address Professor Oak as the poetry man! "
12,34,126,PROFESSOR OAK,"It's no problem at all, Johanna, really! "
12,34,127,JOHANNA,"By the way, thank you for doing what we asked! "
12,34,128,PROFESSOR OAK,"Forget it! I'm looking forward to it, if the truth be told! "
12,34,129,DAWN,Looking forward? Forward to what? 
12,34,130,JOHANNA,Professor Oak is going to attend the Twinleaf Festival as our special guest! 
12,34,131,ASH,"That means I get to see you soon, right? "
12,34,132,PROFESSOR OAK,"That's right, my boy! "
12,34,133,DELIA,"Hi, honey! You look wonderful, Ash! - Glad to see you're well! - "
12,34,134,ASH,"Hi there, Mom! "
12,34,135,DELIA,"I was just bringing the professor fresh herbs, so this is perfect timing! "
12,34,136,JOHANNA,"How nice, Mrs. Ketchum, hello! I'm Dawn's mother, Johanna. Pleasure to meet you! "
12,34,137,DELIA,"Well, thank you for welcoming Ash into your home. Now, if he starts to act up or misbehave, please feel free to scold him as much as needed! - "
12,34,138,ASH,"Aww, Mom! - "
12,34,139,DELIA,"Ash, dear... I realize your journey has taken you far away from me, but I have no doubt you're becoming a fine young man! "
12,34,140,DELIA,"But since he's always been a rambunctious young man, Johanna, please! A bit of a scolding never hurt anyone! "
12,34,141,ASH,"Hey, Mom, whoa! "
12,34,142,PIKACHU,[SHEEPISH] - 
12,34,143,JAMES,I've got you! - 
12,34,144,MEOWTH,Eureka! - 
12,34,145,JESSIE,A bite-a! - 
12,34,146,JAMES,It's a Barboach! 
12,34,147,MEOWTH,"Hey, looks like a bunch of bites... A Finneon! "
12,34,148,JESSIE,It's a bite fest! Heave ho! 
12,34,149,"JAMES, MEOWTH","Wow, a Whiscash! "
12,34,150,JESSIE,"Don't you see? If it's not Goldeen we're grabbing, then we're just wasting valuable rod time! - "
12,34,151,MEOWTH,Now you make sense... - 
12,34,152,JAMES,Back in the drink... 
12,34,153,JAMES,A Crawdaunt we don't want! 
12,34,154,MEOWTH,"Hey, we don't need no stinking Remoraid! "
12,34,155,JESSIE,"Fly in someone else's face, Feebas! "
12,34,156,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",They're blasting off again! 
12,34,157,HAPPINY,[HAPPY] 
12,34,158,JOHANNA,"Brock, you are such a big help! And I had no idea you have a green thumb as well! "
12,34,159,NOELLE,It's amazing! 
12,34,160,BROCK,Odd jobs happen to be what I do best! 
12,34,161,HAPPINY,[PLEASED] 
12,34,162,BROCK,"Now, you two just leave everything to me! I'll have your garden in perfect shape for you in no time! "
12,34,163,NOELLE,"Ms. Johanna, why don't you leave the garden to Brock, - and you and Dawn can battle? - "
12,34,164,JOHANNA,"That's a good idea! How does that sound to you, Dawn? "
12,34,165,DAWN,"That sounds great! Thank you, Mom! "
12,34,166,ASH,"Awesome, buddy, they're finally going to battle! "
12,34,167,CARA,Johanna! 
12,34,168,"ASH, PIKACHU",[SURPRISED] 
12,34,169,CARA,"We're really sorry to bother you while your Dawn is at home, but might we have a word with you? "
12,34,170,JOHANNA,Sure! How can I help you? 
12,34,171,SAYWER,"The problem is, I asked them which food stall should be placed near the Pokémon Battle Ring, which of course is our main festival event. the Octillery snack, or the Altaria cotton candy stall! "
12,34,172,CARA,"Yes, we can't seem to decide which one should go where! "
12,34,173,IZZY,The Octillery snack stall sounds quite nice... 
12,34,174,CARA,"But at the same time, we can't forget that kids really like cotton candy! "
12,34,175,IZZY,"Well, Altaria cotton candy sounds very nice, too! "
12,34,176,CARA,You think? Octillery snacks are really quite popular as well... 
12,34,177,SAYER,"They've been going back and forth like this forever, and they can't seem to make up their minds! "
12,34,178,JOHANNA,"I hear you! Then how about we do both the Octillery snack stall and the Altaria cotton candy stall together, since I know there's still money left over in the festival budget. which would solve the problem by allowing us to have both stalls side by side! "
12,34,179,CARA,Both stalls? 
12,34,180,IZZY,That's what I call very nice! 
12,34,181,SAYER,"Perfect! Both it is, then! You were a great help, Johanna! See you later! "
12,34,182,JOHANNA,"See, it's the first time the three of us are working as festival organizers, and there are so many things we don't know that we're more or less learning as we go along! "
12,34,183,NOELLE,"Guess organizing a festival is challenging, to say the least! "
12,34,184,JOHANNA,So! What were we all talking about again? 
12,34,185,DAWN,"Mom, we were talking about having our Contest Battle! "
12,34,186,PIPLUP,[FRUSTRATED] 
12,34,187,JOHANNA,"Right, the Contest Battle! "
12,34,188,SAYER,"Excuse us... We're really sorry to bother you again, but now they can't seem to decide exactly where to build the two stalls! They just keep going back and forth and back and forth! "
12,34,189,IZZY,The west side of the building is quite nice... 
12,34,190,CARA,West? Do you really think so? 
12,34,191,IZZY,The east side is nice too... 
12,34,192,CARA,"East side? You really think so, huh? "
12,34,193,IZZY,The south side is nice... 
12,34,194,JOHANNA,"There are lots of other food stalls, so why don't the four of us simply walk around the festival site together and then decide which stalls should go where, all right? "
12,34,195,SAYER,Can't tell you how great that would be. 
12,34,196,JOHANNA,"I'll be back in a flash, so why don't you just relax, okay? - "
12,34,197,DAWN,Okay... - 
12,34,198,NOELLE,Don't worry about us! 
12,34,199,DAWN,"I guess there's nothing else to do except wait until Mom gets back. Okay, Piplup? "
12,34,200,PIPLUP,[DISAPPOINTED] 
12,34,201,ASH,"Oh well, that's the way it goes. Hey, I know! Pikachu, I got an idea. Let's go for a little walk and check out Twinleaf Town at the same time! "
12,34,202,ASH,"Dawn, want to come, too? "
12,34,203,DAWN,"No thanks. I'll stay here! Piplup, what do you say we go over our battle strategy - against Mom? - "
12,34,204,ASH,"Okay, catch you later! "
12,34,205,PIKACHU,[HAPPY] 
12,34,206,ASH,"Pikachu, look! "

12,34,214,ASH,It looks like lots of different Pokémon are living around here! 
12,34,215,NATHANIEL [YOUNG BOY],"Psst! Hey you! Don't go that way, please? - "
12,34,216,ASH,Who are you? - 
12,34,217,NATHANIEL,"Hi! I'm Nathaniel, and I just put some Honey on that tree the day before! "
12,34,218,PIKACHU,[QUESTIONING] 
12,34,219,NATHANIEL,"Wow! A Pikachu, right? - "
12,34,220,NATHANIEL,Mind if I hold it? - 
12,34,221,ASH,Go ahead! 
12,34,222,PIKACHU,[DELIGHTED] 
12,34,223,NATHANIEL,"I really want to be a Pokémon Trainer, but I can't, because I'm not old enough yet! - "
12,34,224,ASH,Gotcha! - 
12,34,225,NATHANIEL,"When I get older, I'm definitely going to be a Trainer, but for now, I'm trying to find and study as many Pokémon as I can, and I do it every single day! "
12,34,226,ASH,Every day? Awesome! That's great! - 
12,34,227,NATHANIEL,"Wow, look at that! - "
12,34,228,ASH,Let me see... 
12,34,229,NATHANIEL,A Heracross! How cool is that? 
12,34,230,ASH,"Wow, Nathaniel reminds me of me... "
12,34,231,YOUNG ASH,Wow! I can't wait to grow up and become a Pokémon Trainer! 
12,34,232,ASH,"Of course I'm around Pokémon all the time now, but you know? It's really a privilege to be a Pokémon Trainer! "
12,34,233,NATHANIEL,"And just as soon as I'm old enough to get started on my journey, I'm going to catch tons of Bug-type Pokémon! "
12,34,234,NATHANIEL,"Aww, it took off... "
12,34,235,PIKACHU,[DISAPPOINTED] 
12,34,236,ASH,"So you like Bug types, huh? "
12,34,237,NATHANIEL,Yup! Love them! 
12,34,238,ASH,"Cool! Hey, I caught a Heracross once! - "
12,34,239,NATHANIEL,Wow! Really? - 
12,34,240,ASH,"Yeah, and I also had a Bulbasaur whose sap was my Heracross's favorite in the whole world! It always tried to get some whenever it had a chance! "
12,34,241,NATHANIEL,No way! 
12,34,242,ASH,They were always stirring things up! 
12,34,243,DAWN,So let's go over our strategy one more time! 
12,34,244,DAWN,Now this is the formation for plan A!

12,29,121,JOY,The Pokémon that you saw at Lake Acuity. 
12,29,122,JOY,Was it this one? 
12,29,123,BROCK,"That's it! But now that I think about it, the thing that I saw was more like a shadow than the actual Pokémon itself! "
12,29,124,DAWN,It sounds to me like it was the spirit of Uxie that you saw! 
12,29,125,DAWN,Just like the time when I saw Mesprit on Lake Verity! 
12,29,126,ASH,And just like when I saw Azelf on Lake Valor! 
12,29,127,JOY,"Now, according to this book, it says that all three Pokémon might actually have come from the same Egg! "
12,29,128,JOY,"It also says that from Uxie, who is referred to as The Being of Knowledge, comes the wisdom to solve problems. From Mesprit, called The Being of Emotion, comes the joys and pain of life, and from Azelf, The Being of Willpower, comes the resolve to accomplish whatever task may be at hand. "
12,29,129,JOY,And it's the power of these three that keeps the world in balance...

12,28,226,REGGIE,"Static can cause your opponent to become paralyzed when using a move that makes direct physical contact, so now it looks like Pikachu's got the upper hand. "

Just as some Pokémon have compatibility issues, there can be the same issues between Pokémon and Trainer, and Chimchar's Evolution's a great example! It's not a matter of right or wrong, this battle has both Ash and Paul's pride on the line! That's why this battle will make both Trainers and Pokémon stronger in the long run. "

And as with any challenge between Ash and Paul, one has to wonder what the end result will be! Sometimes it's hard to know, Which way you're supposed to go. But deep inside, you know you're strong. If you follow your heart, you can't be wrong. Stand up! [Stand up!] For what is right. Be brave! Get ready to fight. Hold on! [Hold on!] We're friends for life.

12,27,20,NURSE JOY,As a matter of fact Paul already arrived here earlier and I'm taking care of his Pokémon right now!

12,27,40,ASH,Hello? 
12,27,41,MEOWTH,A Twerp mess. 
12,27,42,ASH,Twerp? 
12,27,43,JESSIE,We meant why you'd traipse way out here is anyone's guess! 
12,27,44,ASH,So the b*ttlefield's not ready yet? 
12,27,45,JAMES,Sorry zippy! Won't be finished for two or three days! 
12,27,46,JESSIE,"Battling day in and day out has pummeled this place to a battle pulp, so we're sprucing it up in one gulp! "
12,27,47,MEOWTH,Better take your battling buisness elsewhere. 
12,27,48,ASH,"Whoa, now what do we do? "
12,27,49,OLIVIER,You must be Ash from Pallet Town! 
12,27,50,ASH,"That's me, yeah! "
12,27,51,OLIVIER,I've been waiting for you! The name is Olivier and I'm a traveling referee! I got a call from Reggie a few days ago asking me to come to Lake Acuity and officiate the Pokémon Battle between you and Paul! 
12,27,52,ASH,Great! But the b*ttlefield's closed. 
12,27,53,OLIVIER,Don't worry! Reggie told me he's got a back-up plan just in case! 
12,27,54,PAUL,"Now Electabuzz, Thunder Punch! "
12,27,55,ELECTABUZZ,[THUNDER PUNCH MOVE] 
12,27,56,REGGIE,It's amazing that you've been able to perfect your Pokémon's moves in just ten days! 
12,27,57,PAUL,I remember what you asked me ten days ago. 
12,27,58,REGGIE,Hey Paul! Do you think there's any chance you and Ash could treat us to a full Battle? 
12,27,59,PAUL,So why have a Battle now? 
12,27,60,REGGIE,It just seems like your Battle with Brandon had a major effect on you. Now seems like the perfect time! 
12,27,61,NURSE JOY,Your Pokémon are all ready for your Battle. Now everybody's in tip-top shape! 
12,27,62,"STRAPTOR, CHIMCHAR, GROTLE, PIKACHU, BUIZEL, GLISCOR",[HAPPY]

12,27,65,PIPLUP,[AGREEING] 
12,27,66,DAWN,And you can count on us to cheer you on big time! 
12,27,67,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
12,27,68,ASH,Thanks Dawn! And I'm going to win this too! Just as soon as I defeat Paul and his Pokémon he'll have no choice but to finally give me a little respect for my Training style! So let's move it! We'll show Paul what we've got and give him a taste of what we can really do! 
12,27,69,"STARAPTOR, GROTLE, PIKACHU, GLISCOR, BUIZEL CHIMCHAR",[ENTHUSIASTIC] 
12,27,70,ASH,"Wow! Chimchar you're all fired up, aren't you? "
12,27,71,CHIMCHAR,[EAGER] 
12,27,72,BROCK,Watching Chimchar reminds me of what Cynthia once told us. 
12,27,73,DAWN,"You mean when she said ""When every life meets another life, something will be born""? "
12,27,74,BROCK,Right but that's not all. She also spoke of a larger than life destiny waiting for Chimchar. And that Chimchar is the touchstone for Ash and Paul's relationship! 
12,27,75,ASH,Everybody ready? 
12,27,76,"STARAPTOR, CHIMCHAR, GROTLE, PIKACHU, BUIZEL, GLISCOR",[EXCITED] 
12,27,77,REGGIE,Here they come! 
12,27,78,PAUL,Electabuzz return. 
12,27,79,REGGIE,Thanks for coming Ash! Welcome! I really believe the two of you were destined to battle each other this way. 
12,27,80,ASH,The two of us? 
12,27,81,REGGIE,"You see, you and Paul are completely different yet you're a lot alike too! Both of you wish to become strong with your Pokémon yet your training methods are at opposites. "
12,27,82,REGGIE,"So, as long as you're both this tuned in to each other and also have the desire to become stronger I think a full Battle between you two is unavoidable! As rivals, you need to know each other's current strength. You need to learn how powerful each other has become, and that will lead to your own evolution as a Trainer! "
12,27,83,ASH,Wait! Me-evolve? 
12,27,84,REGGIE,"You too, Paul! "
12,27,85,PAUL,Where do we battle? 
12,27,86,REGGIE,Right here! 
12,27,87,ASH,Right here? Really? 
12,27,88,REGGIE,"Well we can't use the field at the Pokémon Center, so I thought it might be nice to give it your all out in the great outdoors! "
12,27,89,ASH,Sure! How's it sound Paul? 
12,27,90,PAUL,It doesn't matter to me. 
12,27,91,REGGIE,That settles it! 
12,27,92,OLIVIER,Good! We're all decided! 
12,27,93,"ASH, DAWN, BROCK, PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[SURPRISE] 
12,27,94,REGGIE,Ready to referee? 
12,27,95,OLIVIER,I sure am! And now for my help! 
12,27,96,"JAMES, JESSIE, MEOWTH",That's us! 
12,27,97,MEOWTH,Helping! 
12,27,98,DAWN,"Wow, awesome! What's that? "
12,27,99,PIPLUP,[AWE] 
12,27,100,OLIVIER,"It's a portable reference monitor! Okay team, all set? "
12,27,101,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",Right! Couldn't be any more setter! 
12,27,102,OLIVIER,"Representing Kanto is Ash from Pallet Town! Representing Sinnoh is Paul from Veilstone City! We now begin a six on six full Battle! There is no time limit, and both sides may exchange Pokémon freely as desired! The Battle will be over when all six Pokémon on either side are unable to continue! We will now use coin toss to see who will mount the first att*ck! "
12,27,103,OLIVIER,"All right then Trainers heads or tails, what will it be? "
12,27,104,ASH,I call heads! 
12,27,105,PAUL,Then tails! 
12,27,106,OLIVIER,Heads! So Ash has the honor! 
12,27,107,ASH,"Okay Pikachu, let's do this! "
12,27,108,PIKACHU,[READY]

12,27,113,ASH,"Torterra, huh? "
12,27,114,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",A button here and button there! 
12,27,115,OLIVIER,All right let the Battle begin!

12,27,119,"DAWN, PIPLUP",[SHOCKED] 
12,27,120,JESSIE,Having second thoughts is usually not the Twerp way. 
12,27,121,JAMES,How does he change his mind when he has none? 
12,27,122,MEOWTH,I was looking forward to watching Buizel kick someone else's booty for a change! 
12,27,123,WOBBUFFET,[AGREEING] 
12,27,124,ASH,"Buizel, I really wanted to battle with you but the thing is Water-type moves don't work really well against Torterra! So hang tight until the next time! You're up instead! Gliscor, I choose you! "
12,27,125,GLISCOR,[APPEARING] 
12,27,126,ASH,"Paul, remember Gliscor? You met it back when it was still a Gligar. "
12,27,127,JAMES,Wow. The taller Twerp seems to be tongue-tied. 
12,27,128,JESSIE,Better gagged than grouchy. 
12,27,129,WOBBUFFET,[AGREEING] 
12,27,130,ASH,"Gliscor, now! Sand att*ck! "
12,27,131,GLISCOR,[SAND att*ck MOVE] 
12,27,132,TORTERRA,[BRACING] 
12,27,133,REGGIE,Using Sand att*ck was a wise move. 
12,27,134,BROCK,Ash has battled against Torterra several times in the past and watched it in battle as well. He really knows Torterra's moves so he's blocking its vision! 
12,27,135,PAUL,Giga Drain! 
12,27,136,TORTERRA,[GIGA DRAIN MOVE] 
12,27,137,GLISCOR,[SMUG] 
12,27,138,TORTERRA,[SURPRISED] 
12,27,139,DAWN,It worked! Torterra missed! 
12,27,140,BROCK,I have a sneaking suspicion Paul used that att*ck knowing it was going to miss. 
12,27,141,"DAWN, PIPLUP",[SURPRISE] 
12,27,142,REGGIE,I think you're right! Purposefully while still in that Sand att*ck! 
12,27,143,DAWN,But why? 
12,27,144,REGGIE,"To try and get Ash to let down his guard a bit! When an opponent's att*ck misses, a Trainer can get a bit too comfortable mentally. "
12,27,145,ASH,Now Gliscor use X-Scissor! 
12,27,146,GLISCOR,[X-SCISSOR MOVE] 
12,27,147,TORTERRA,[PAINED] 
12,27,148,GLISCOR,[EXERTION] 
12,27,149,TORTERRA,[PAINED] 
12,27,150,PIKACHU,[SHOCKED] 
12,27,151,ASH,Check that out! Torterra took it! 
12,27,152,PAUL,Frenzy Plant! 
12,27,153,TORTERRA,[FRENZY PLANT MOVE] 
12,27,154,DAWN,Awesome! 
12,27,155,PIPLUP,[IMPRESSED] 
12,27,156,BROCK,Frenzy Plant is the most dynamic Grass-type move with all of that sheer power on tap! 
12,27,157,REGGIE,"Yeah, but it's a risky move too. "
12,27,158,ASH,"Now, up Gliscor! "
12,27,159,GLISCOR,[SOARING] 
12,27,160,TORTERRA,[PAINED] 
12,27,161,DAWN,Torterra's in trouble! 
12,27,162,REGGIE,That's the risk of Frenzy Plant! After that att*ck Torterra won't be able to move for awhile. 
12,27,163,ASH,Now's our chance! Use Fire Fang! 
12,27,164,GLISCOR,[FIRE FANG MOVE] 
12,27,165,TORTERRA,[PAINED] 
12,27,166,BROCK,Torterra felt that! 
12,27,167,GLISCOR,[EXERTION] 
12,27,168,ASH,Use X-Scissor! 
12,27,169,GLISCOR,[X SCISSOR MOVE] 
12,27,170,TORTERRA,[PAINED] 
12,27,171,ASH,"Yeah! That worked too! Gliscor lets use one more att*ck! Steel Wing, let's go! "
12,27,172,GLISCOR,[STEEL WING MOVE] 
12,27,173,PAUL,Torterra Crunch! 
12,27,174,TORTERRA,[CRUNCH MOVE] 
12,27,175,GLISCOR,[PAINED] 
12,27,176,ASH,Gliscor no! 
12,27,177,DAWN,Gliscor got caught! 
12,27,178,PIPLUP,[CONCERNED] 
12,27,179,TORTERRA,[ANGRY] 
12,27,180,GLISCOR,[WORRIED] 
12,27,181,PAUL,Now Giga Drain! 
12,27,182,TORTERRA,[GIGA GRAIN MOVE] 
12,27,183,ASH,Oh no! 
12,27,184,PIKACHU,[CONCERNED] 
12,27,185,GLISCOR,[PAINED] 
12,27,186,DAWN,Gliscor your power's being drained! You've got to get away quick! 
12,27,187,PIPLUP,[PANICKING] 
12,27,188,GLISCOR,[STRUGGLING] 
12,27,189,ASH,Come on Gliscor stay strong! 
12,27,190,PIKACHU,[URGING] 
12,27,191,BROCK,"So this is what Paul was after! If Torterra became immobilized from the Frenzy Plant, he knew Ash would unleash a barrage of close range att*cks! "
12,27,192,GLISCOR,[STRUGGLING] 
12,27,193,REGGIE,"Right! Paul is well aware that Ash knows Torterra's battling style, so he formulated his strategy around that! "
12,27,194,DAWN,"Oh, man. "
12,27,195,ASH,Hang in there Gliscor! Use Fire Fang! 
12,27,196,GLISCOR,[FIRE FANG MOVE] 
12,27,197,TORTERRA,[PAINED] 
12,27,198,DAWN,Way to go! 
12,27,199,GLISCOR,[STRUGGLING] 
12,27,200,DAWN,Torterra's Crunch did lots of damage! 
12,27,201,ASH,"Okay, Gliscor return! "
12,27,202,TORTERRA,[TIRED] 
12,27,203,DAWN,"I know this Battle's just getting started, but I can hardly breathe just from watching! "
12,27,204,PIPLUP,[CONCERNED] 
12,27,205,ASH,Take a good rest! I promise nothing you did will go to waste! Torterra's taken that much damage but Paul still won't switch Pokémon! 
12,27,206,ASH,"Now! It's time to finish this thing up! Staraptor, I choose you! "
12,27,207,STARAPTOR,[APPEARING] 
12,27,208,REGGIE,"Staraptor must've evolved from the Staravia I battled once, right? "
12,27,209,DAWN,Right! Staraptor even b*at Paul's Honchkrow in a Pokéringer match! 
12,27,210,REGGIE,Wow Paul's Honchkrow? That's pretty amazing! 
12,27,211,ASH,All right. Brave Bird! 
12,27,212,STARAPTOR,[BRAVE BIRD MOVE] 
12,27,213,PAUL,Use Stone Edge! 
12,27,214,ASH,Stone Edge. Why? 
12,27,215,TORTERRA,[STONE EDGE MOVE] 
12,27,216,STARAPTOR,[PAINED] 
12,27,217,ASH,"Staraptor, no! "
12,27,218,TORTERRA,[PROUD] 
12,27,219,BROCK,Wow! That was super effective! That's the reason Paul didn't switch Pokémon! 
12,27,220,REGGIE,There's no doubt in my mind Paul was expecting Ash to bring out Staraptor next! That's why he used Stone Edge to stop Staraptor's Brave Bird and all of Ash's continued assaults as well. Do either of you know if Ash came up with a battling strategy for today? Like maybe switching which Pokémon he was going to be using against Paul. 
12,27,221,DAWN,"No, I think Ash was planning on using those six Pokémon right from the beginning! "
12,27,222,BROCK,"You see except for Pikachu, Ash got all of his Pokémon after coming here to Sinnoh. "
12,27,223,REGGIE,I knew it! Paul picked his Pokémon line-up based on all the previous Battles he's had against Ash! That's why he can predict with such accuracy what Pokémon is coming next. 
12,27,224,PAUL,Weavile! Stand by for battle! 
12,27,225,WEAVILE,[APPEARING] 
12,27,226,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",Status update coming right up! 
12,27,227,STARAPTOR,[STRUGGLING] 
12,27,228,ASH,"Staraptor, can you still battle? "
12,27,229,STARAPTOR,[CONFIRMING] 
12,27,230,ASH,"All right then, Quick att*ck! "
12,27,231,STARAPTOR,[QUICK att*ck MOVE] 
12,27,232,WEAVILE,[DEFENDING] 
12,27,233,PAUL,Use Swords Dance! 
12,27,234,WEAVILE,[SWORDS DANCE MOVE] 
12,27,235,DAWN,What's that? 
12,27,236,REGGIE,It's called Swords Dance and it increases its user's att*ck power! 
12,27,237,ASH,"Now, Aerial Ace! "
12,27,238,STARAPTOR,[AERIAL ACE MOVE] 
12,27,239,PAUL,Blizzard! 
12,27,240,WEAVILE,[BLIZZARD MOVE] 
12,27,241,STARAPTOR,[PAINED] 
12,27,242,PAUL,Now use Metal Claw! 
12,27,243,WEAVILE,[METAL CLAW MOVE] 
12,27,244,STARAPTOR,[SHOCKED] 
12,27,245,PIKACHU,[SHOCKED] 
12,27,246,"JESSIE, MEOWTH, JAMES",Whoa! 
12,27,247,BROCK,Weavile's faster than Staraptor? 
12,27,248,WEAVILE,[METAL CLAW MOVE] 
12,27,249,STARAPTOR,[PAINED] 
12,27,250,WEAVILE,[EXERTION] 
12,27,251,PAUL,"Go after it Weavile, quick! "
12,27,252,WEAVILE,[EXERTION] 
12,27,253,ASH,It's coming! Close Combat! 
12,27,254,STARAPTOR,[ANGRY] 
12,27,255,PAUL,"Metal Claw, now! "
12,27,256,WEAVILE,[METAL CLAW MOVE] 
12,27,257,STARAPTOR,[CLOSE COMBAT MOVE] 
12,27,258,REGGIE,"Staraptor, it has the advantage! That's a super effective move! "
12,27,259,STARAPTOR,[CLOSE COMBAT MOVE] 
12,27,260,WEAVILE,[PAINED] 
12,27,261,PAUL,Blizzard! 
12,27,262,ASH,Brave Bird let's go! 
12,27,263,WEAVILE,[BLIZZARD MOVE] 
12,27,264,STARAPTOR,[BRAVE BIRD MOVE] 
12,27,265,WEAVILE,[DAZED] 
12,27,266,OLIVIER,Weavile is unable to battle so the winner is Staraptor! 
12,27,267,STARAPTOR,[EXERTION] 
12,27,268,ASH,Staraptor you were awesome! 
12,27,269,PIKACHU,[HAPPY] 
12,27,270,STARAPTOR,[PROUD] 
12,27,271,DAWN,All right that's one Pokémon down! 
12,27,272,PIPLUP,[HAPPY] 
12,27,273,WEAVILE,[GROANING] 
12,27,274,ASH,This's no time to celebrate! That Weavile was moving even faster than Staraptor! 
12,27,275,JAMES,"Finally, a Pokémon hits the dirt! "
12,27,276,MEOWTH,But if you think the little Twerp's romping happily in the park think again! 
12,27,277,JESSIE,I'm ready for a battle nap. 
12,27,278,ASH,All right Staraptor return! You deserve a good rest! 
12,27,279,PAUL,Electabuzz! Stand by for battle! 
12,27,280,ASH,"Grotle, I choose you! "
12,27,281,ELECTABUZZ,[APPEARING] 
12,27,282,GROTLE,[APPEARING] 
12,27,283,ASH,"An Electric type. What's he up to? All right Grotle, Energy Ball! "
12,27,284,GROTLE,[ENERGY BALL MOVE] 
12,27,285,PAUL,"Light Screen, let's go! "
12,27,286,ELECTABUZZ,[LIGHT SCREEN att*ck] 
12,27,287,DAWN,Electabuzz took Grotle's Energy Ball! 
12,27,288,BROCK,"Light Screen is a move that cuts the effect of Special att*cks down by half! Energy Ball is a Special att*ck, so Electabuzz barely felt it! "
12,27,289,ASH,Paul's switching Pokémon already? 
12,27,290,PIKACHU,[SHOCKED] 
12,27,291,PAUL,Honchkrow! Standby for battle! 
12,27,292,HONCHKROW,[APPEARING] 
12,27,293,GROTLE,[CHALLENGING] 
12,27,294,ASH,"Uh oh, Honchkrow. "
12,27,295,BROCK,Those two Pokémon battled against each other before. And right in the middle of the whole thing Turtwig evolved into Grotle! 
12,27,296,REGGIE,Now I see. Then Grotle's angry reaction goes back to that Battle! 
12,27,297,GROTLE,[RESOLUTE] 
12,27,298,ASH,All right Grotle you're on! It's time to show those two what you've got! 
12,27,299,GROTLE,[CONFIRMING] 
12,27,300,DAWN,But Honchkrow's got the advantage because of type! 
12,27,301,PIPLUP,[AGREEING] 
12,27,302,ASH,Grotle Razor Leaf! 
12,27,303,GROTLE,[RAZOR LEAF MOVE] 
12,27,304,HONCHKROW,[EXERTION] 
12,27,305,PAUL,Night Slash! 
12,27,306,HONCHKROW,[NIGHT SLASH MOVE] 
12,27,307,GROTLE,[PAINED] 
12,27,308,ASH,All right Grotle Energy Ball! GROTLE [ENERGY BALL MOVE] 
12,27,309,ASH,"What the, Light Screen? "
12,27,310,DAWN,So I guess the effects of Light Screen must carry through to the next Pokémon.is that right? 
12,27,311,BROCK,"Not only does Honchkrow have a type advantage, but with Light Screen still in play, it decreases the damage from Grotle's Special att*cks! Paul's goal is obviously to overwhelm Ash! "
12,27,312,DAWN,He wants to overwhelm Ash? 
12,27,313,PAUL,"Now, use Haze! "
12,27,314,HONCHKROW,[HAZE MOVE] 
12,27,315,GROTLE,[SHOCKED] 
12,27,316,DAWN,"You know, now that you mention it, Paul's battle style seems different than usual. "
12,27,317,BROCK,Normally the Battles we've seen Paul in are ones where he's busy polishing his Pokémon's moves or when his complete objective is testing their strength. 
12,27,318,ASH,Razor Leaf let's go! 
12,27,319,GROTLE,[RAZOR LEAF MOVE] 
12,27,320,BROCK,But it's not like that at all today! 
12,27,321,REGGIE,"A Pokémon Battle will test both a Trainer's intellectual ability as well as judgment. Yeah, Paul has dissected Ash's Battle style, that keeps Ash from Battling soundly. And that means, Paul's going at it with nothing less for his goal than a one hundred percent sure win! "
12,27,322,ASH,Grotle's taken a lot of damage. Use Synthesis! 
12,27,323,GROTLE,[SYNTHESIS MOVE] 
12,27,324,PAUL,"Now, Sky att*ck, quick! "
12,27,325,HONCHKROW,[AGREE] 
12,27,326,DAWN,Oh no! But Grotle hasn't finished recovering yet! 
12,27,327,ASH,Now! Grotle use Rock Climb! 
12,27,328,GROTLE,[ROCK CLIMB MOVE] 
12,27,329,HONCHKROW,[SKY att*ck MOVE] 
12,27,330,GROTLE,[DAZED] 
12,27,331,OLIVIER,Grotle is unable to battle and the winner is Honchkrow! 
12,27,332,JAMES,Springing into action with both Twerps a Pokémon lighter! 
12,27,333,ASH,"Grotle, return! You battled really well! "
12,27,334,REGGIE,Ash miscalculated the timing on when to use Synthesis. 
12,27,335,REGGIE,Using a healing move leaves your Pokémon completely vulnerable! Consider your opponent's condition then use it! Or be an easy target like Grotle. 
12,27,336,BROCK,It sound like Ash is feeling a lot of pressure... 
12,27,337,DAWN,You think so? 
12,27,338,BROCK,Ash wanted Grotle to defeat Honchkrow so badly that it clouded his judgment! 
12,27,339,PIKACHU,[DEMANDING] 
12,27,340,ASH,You wanna get in the Battle Pikachu? 
12,27,341,PIKACHU,[CONFIRMING] 
12,27,342,ASH,Yes! Then you get in there buddy and let's show them some of your power! Now let's move Pikachu! 
12,27,343,PIKACHU,[READY] 
12,27,344,PAUL,Magmortar! Stand by for battle! 
12,27,345,MAGMORTAR,[APPEARING] 
12,27,346,PIKACHU,[SHOCKED] 
12,27,347,"BROCK, DAWN, PIPLUP",[WORRIED] 
12,27,348,ASH,Magmortar! Man he really evolved his Magmar. 
12,27,349,NARRATOR,"Both Trainers may be one Pokémon down, but Paul continues to overwhelm Ash with his carefully thought out strategy! Now, what kind of fierce battling will we see from this point onward? You'll have to stay tuned to find out the answer"
12,26,0,NARRATOR,"Leaving Snowpoint City behind, our heroes are now on a train bound for Lake Acuity, where Ash's Battle with Paul is soon to take place! "
12,26,1,ASH,A full Battle tomorrow between me and Paul! Guess what? I'm going to b*at him so bad he'll never forget it! 
12,26,2,DAWN,[SHOCKED] 
12,26,3,ASH,[SHOCKED] 
12,26,4,BROCK,"Whoa, look out! "
12,26,5,LOOKER,"Oh boy, I'll tell you. That's some voice you have! I sure was startled. "
12,26,6,ASH,I'm so sorry! You all right? 
12,26,7,LOOKER,Don't worry. I'm fine! 
12,26,8,DAWN,What's with you? That sure came out of left field. 
12,26,9,ASH,"Sorry, but I was just thinking about tomorrow's Battle with Paul. "
12,26,10,DAWN,No surprise there! 
12,26,11,PIKACHU,[AGREEING] 
12,26,12,BROCK,"Boxed lunches.didn't they come from the train station? You've got quite a collection, I see! "
12,26,13,LOOKER,They're so good I couldn't resist! I've got plenty so you keep those! 
12,26,14,BROCK,But how could we after startling you like we did? 
12,26,15,LOOKER,"It's okay, it's okay! It's not like I ordered too many or was panicking because I couldn't find my wallet and almost missed the train or anything crazy like that! "
12,26,16,ASH,"Okay then, thanks! That's really nice of you to do! And by the way my name's Ash! "
12,26,17,PIKACHU,[GREETING] 
12,26,18,DAWN,Hi! My name's Dawn! 
12,26,19,PIPLUP,[GREETING] 
12,26,20,BROCK,And my name's Brock! Thank you very much! 
12,26,21,LOOKER,Hi! Looker's the name! Nice to meet you. Would you three like some too? I hear these things are really delicious. 
12,26,22,JAMES,A freebie for us? 
12,26,23,MEOWTH,Thanks! We ain't strangers to accepting gifts from strangers! 
12,26,24,JESSIE,Zero modesty is a small price to pay for free food! 
12,26,25,MEOWTH,Sure looks good! 
12,26,26,LOOKER,Seems every passenger on the train has one! But I still have more of these left than I know what to do with! Of course! There's still the conductor the engineer and the assistant Pokémon too! That should get rid of all of them! 
12,26,27,ASH,Assistant Pokémon? 
12,26,28,BROCK,I think there's an Electric-type Pokémon working on this train! 
12,26,29,ASH,An Electric type? Sounds cool! 
12,26,30,DAWN,"I wonder which Pokémon it is! Sometimes it's hard to know, Which way you're supposed to go. But deep inside, you know you're strong. If you follow your heart, you can't be wrong. Stand up! [Stand up!] For what is right. Be brave! Get ready to fight. Hold on! [Hold on!] We're friends for life. And if we come, together as one, Complete the quest, that we've begun, We will win the battle! Galactic Battles! Pokémon! Galactic Battles! Pokémon! "
12,26,31,ENGINEER,"Steep incline ahead. Ampharos, please use Thunderbolt. "
12,26,32,AMPHAROS,[THUNDERBOLT MOVE] 
12,26,33,ENGINEER,Thunderbolt confirmed. Full speed ahead! 
12,26,34,ENGINEER,And now we're all clear! Excellent work Ampharos. 
12,26,35,AMPHAROS,[GRATEFUL] 
12,26,36,DAWN,Awesome! So Ampharos is helping engineer the train! 
12,26,37,ASH,"Ampharos, wow! "
12,26,38,POKEDEX,Ampharos. The Light Pokémon. The tip of its tail shines so brightly that in days gone by people used it to send signals to each other with the light. 
12,26,39,CONDUCTOR,Ampharos is a big help! When it comes to things like traveling over steep inclines or starting from a full stop Ampharos is an indispensable part of our team! 
12,26,40,ASH,[AMAZED] 
12,26,41,ASH,They work great together too! 
12,26,42,PIKACHU,[AGREEING] 
12,26,43,LOOKER,Here! These are for you all so please enjoy! 
12,26,44,CONDUCTOR,Wow! Thank you so much! 
12,26,45,ENGINEER,Confirming stop signal! Stopping! 
12,26,46,LOOKER,[SURPRISE] 
12,26,47,DAWN,I don't get it. 
12,26,48,PIPLUP,[CONFUSED] 
12,26,49,LOOKER,See that light up ahead? 
12,26,50,CONDUCTOR,Right! And it's red! 
12,26,51,JESSIE,The fun of feeling full! 
12,26,52,JESSIE,A railway lunchbox really makes the trip! 
12,26,53,JAMES,And what a generous gentleman! It seems the only thing I've been given lately is grief! 
12,26,54,MEOWTH,"Let's let this grub digest a bit and then go and cop Pikachu! With these dapper disguises those dumb Twerps don't have an inkling we're on the Twerpish take, you know? "
12,26,55,JAMES,We're inert! That's odd. 
12,26,56,JESSIE,Unless we're stopping to hug a few trees I agree! 
12,26,57,MEOWTH,I think that red light's doing the talking! 
12,26,58,ENGINEER,"Understood. Thanks very much. According to the Command Center no trouble has been reported to warrant a red light, but there's no mechanical malfunction either. "
12,26,59,DAWN,Wow! So I wonder why there's a red signal then. 
12,26,60,CONDUCTOR,It's possible there's some kind of trouble that hasn't been reported yet. I think I'll go check it out! 
12,26,61,ENGINEER,Please do. 
12,26,62,LOOKER,"Uh, please wait! "
12,26,63,LOOKER,I'll go with you! 
12,26,64,ASH,You're going to go too? 
12,26,65,PIKACHU,[CONFUSED] 
12,26,66,LOOKER,"Right! I've always wanted to be able to take a walk in this gorgeous area! All right then, shall we? "
12,26,67,CONDUCTOR,"Uh, okay! Sorry for this inconvenience, but please wait here. "
12,26,68,ASH,Right! 
12,26,69,ENGINEER,"So, I'll let the other passengers know what's going on. "
12,26,70,ASH,Okay.

12,26,72,AMPHAROS,[AGREEING] 
12,26,73,BROCK,"And, in the meantime why don't we have lunch? "
12,26,74,DAWN,Great idea! I can't wait to try the lunches he gave us! 
12,26,75,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
12,26,76,ASH,[HAPPY] 
12,26,77,JESSIE,Nothing like watching a bunch of Twerps have a jolly old time! 
12,26,78,JAMES,Let's turn it into our jolly old time! We'll pilfer Pikachu and a plethora of Pokémon! 
12,26,79,JESSIE,"Oh, you're on. "
12,26,80,MEOWTH,Got to strike when the iron is hot! And if it were any hotter it'd melt! 
12,26,81,ENGINEER,We're terribly sorry. 
12,26,82,ENGINEER,"We didn't know you were in such a rush. We'll be moving just as soon as we have confirmation that it's safe to go, so thanks for your patience. "
12,26,83,ENGINEER,"But for now, you're welcome to go enjoy the great outdoors! The highland breeze is quite refreshing. "
12,26,84,JESSIE,"Hey, don't waste your breath Bub! We were right in the middle of catching all those Twerp Pokémon. "
12,26,85,MEOWTH,I think she ate too much! 
12,26,86,JAMES,Perhaps a teensy breath of fresh country air will snap her out of it! 
12,26,87,ENGINEER,A wise idea! And we'll both be outside as well while we inspect the train! 
12,26,88,AMPHAROS,[AGREEING] 
12,26,89,LOOKER,"Hmm, obviously this track hasn't been used in quite a while, but any rust that should be there has been worn right off and it almost looks like new! "
12,26,90,CONDUCTOR,Now who could have done this? 
12,26,91,CONDUCTOR,Someone changed the controls. The track switch too! 
12,26,92,LOOKER,They must have done it deliberately - so our train would stop. While they used the abandoned track. 
12,26,93,LOOKER,Oh it's all fairly simple when you give it a good look! A train must've just come through. 
12,26,94,CONDUCTOR,But why would somebody do that then? 
12,26,95,LOOKER,"Well, that's not so clear. "
12,26,96,CONDUCTOR,Mr. Looker we need to return to the train at once! I'll make a full report and check the next crossing!

12,26,132,MEOWTH,"If you really think we'd give up these cuties when things are going our way, you don't deserve them in the first place! "
12,26,133,JESSIE,Twerps can be such a down when things are looking up. 
12,26,134,JAMES,Yup!

12,25,22,ASH,"No, I've never heard of it, but I'd sure like to! "
12,25,23,MARIA,"All right, then. It happened a long time ago. Once, after a volcano violently erupted, the Snowpoint forest, rich in natural resources and beauty, was transformed into a sea of flowing lava! Then, out of a bright blue light, Regigigas appeared! "
12,25,24,ASH,Regigigas? 
12,25,25,MARIA,"Correct. Along with Regice, Regirock and Registeel. Together, the four of them halted the volcano's eruption, thus saving Snowpoint City from destruction. "
12,25,26,MARIA,"Later, Regigigas transformed itself into a stone of light and fell into a deep sleep, while in order to protect Regigigas, the legend says Regirock, Regice and Registeel were transformed into three guardian pillars made of the basic elements of the land: rock, ice and steel. "
12,25,27,BRANDON,And their location is the Snowpoint Temple. 
12,25,28,ASH,So what does that group of people have to do with it? 
12,25,29,BRANDON,They're most likely after Regigigas! 
12,25,30,JAMES,He said Regigigas! 
12,25,31,JESSIE,Who would've thought a Legendary Pokémon would be in a temple taking a nap! 
12,25,32,MEOWTH,"Hey, if you snooze you lose, but we could win by giving it to the Boss as a present! "
12,25,33,MEOWTH,Trading in a Legend for - big dough! We're blasting off again!

12,25,35,DAWN,Look! 
12,25,36,ASH,"Hey, it's Pokémon Hunter J! "
12,25,37,PIKACHU,[ANGRY] 
12,25,38,MARIA,Who's Pokémon Hunter J? 
12,25,39,BRANDON,Part of a group that steals Pokémon and sells them on the black market! 
12,25,40,DAWN,"But, Brandon I thought you just told us that the sleeping Regigigas was only a legend right? "
12,25,41,BRANDON,Not so! There has been sufficient evidence uncovered that shows it's not just a legend! That's why I came here! 
12,25,42,ASH,"Right! That means they'll do whatever it takes to catch Regigigas, so we've got to do something first! "
12,25,43,HENCHMEN A,It's the Battle Pyramid! 
12,25,44,HENCHMEN B,Someone report to J immediately!

12,24,18,CANDICE,"But it's nothing like this, that's for sure! Sometimes it's hard to know, Which way you're supposed to go. But deep inside, you know you're strong. If you follow your heart, you can't be wrong. Stand up! [Stand up!] For what is right. Be brave! Get ready to fight. Hold on! [Hold on!] We're friends for life. And if we come, together as one, Complete the quest, that we've begun, We will win the battle! Galactic Battles! Pokémon! Galactic Battles! Pokémon! "
12,24,19,ZOEY,"Wow, I've got to admit, I'm surprised Paul was Chimchar's first Trainer! "
12,24,20,ZOEY,"Whoa. And from what I can see, Ash and Paul couldn't be more different if they tried! "
12,24,21,BROCK,Which is exactly why the two of them couldn't ignore each other if they tried. 
12,24,22,DAWN,"Speaking of Ash, where did he go? "
12,24,23,MAGMAR,[FLAMETHROWER MOVE] 
12,24,24,ELECTABUZZ,[ANGRY] 
12,24,25,PAUL,That's good! Now use Flamethrower and face the sky! 
12,24,26,MAGMAR,[FLAMETHROWER MOVE] 
12,24,27,PAUL,Good! 
12,24,28,ASH,"Hey, Paul! "
12,24,29,ASH,"Man, you should have seen how totally awesome Grotle was today! I wanna thank Torterra again for the help. "
12,24,30,ASH,That battling style Torterra showed us awhile back worked out really well! 
12,24,31,PAUL,You said you were serious about wanting to win in Snowpoint City so why do you still need Torterra to hold your hand? 
12,24,32,ASH,[ANGRY] 
12,24,33,PAUL,"Using a Grass - type in an Ice - type Gym, I guess you chalk that up to blind faith. "
12,24,34,ZOEY,Stop right there! Just who do you think you are? 
12,24,35,DAWN,"Zoey, stop! "
12,24,36,ZOEY,He has no right talking like that! 
12,24,37,ASH,"It's okay, Zoey. "
12,24,38,ZOEY,I just hope tomorrow at the Gym battle. 
12,24,39,ZOEY,Ms. Senior wipes the floor with that jerk! 
12,24,40,PAUL,Reggie! 
12,24,41,REGGIE,"Hey, Paul! How's it going? T."
12,24,42,V.,And it looks like the entire Sinnoh region will have good weather today. 
12,24,43,ASH,Reggie! 
12,24,44,DAWN,Wow! It's true! 
12,24,45,ZOEY,Who's that guy? 
12,24,46,DAWN,"That's Paul's big brother, Reggie! He's a Breeder down in Veilstone City! "
12,24,47,REGGIE,Have you gotten past the Snowpoint Gym? 
12,24,48,PAUL,Coming soon. 
12,24,49,REGGIE,"Well, keep in mind that Candice is tough! "
12,24,50,PAUL,I've got a plan for her. 
12,24,51,ASH,Reggie! 
12,24,52,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
12,24,53,REGGIE,"Would you look at that? Wow, it's been a long time! "
12,24,54,DAWN,"Yeah, it really has! "
12,24,55,ASH,It's great to see you! What are you doing here? 
12,24,56,REGGIE,"I just finished bringing a Pokémon I was watching back to its Trainer. You challenging the Snowpoint Gym, too? "
12,24,57,ASH,"Yeah, I battled Candice yesterday and won the badge! "
12,24,58,REGGIE,"Really? Awesome! Hey, hear that Paul? That's great, huh? "
12,24,59,REGGIE,Okay if I come watch your battle? 
12,24,60,PAUL,Whatever you want. 
12,24,61,ZOEY,"Man, that guy Paul may be the total opposite of Ash, but he's absolutely nothing like his brother either! "
12,24,62,DAWN,For sure! 
12,24,63,PIPLUP,[SURPRISED] 
12,24,64,DAWN,[SHOCKED] 
12,24,65,ASH,What's that?[SHOCKED] 
12,24,66,ASH,[SHOCKED] 
12,24,67,REGGIE,Whoa! 
12,24,68,DAWN,What's that? 
12,24,69,PIPLUP,[CONFUSED] 
12,24,70,ASH,It's the Battle Pyramid! 
12,24,71,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
12,24,72,REGGIE,"Wow, you guys know about that thing? "
12,24,73,ASH,Yeah! I finally b*at it but it took me a bunch of tries! 
12,24,74,PAUL,What? You b*at it? 
12,24,75,JESSIE,Tell me that's not the Battle Pyramid. 
12,24,76,JAMES,"I'd be lying if I did, though from Kanto it's quite a haul. "
12,24,77,MEOWTH,Even flyboys need a change of scene! 
12,24,78,WOBBUFFET,[AGREEING] 
12,24,79,JESSIE,No way. 
12,24,80,CANDICE,"Oh, wow! "
12,24,81,SAM,Transmission from the Snowpoint City Pokémon Center! 
12,24,82,ASH,"Hey, Brandon, Long time no see! It's Ash from Pallet Town! "
12,24,83,BRANDON,I'll be! So how are you kid? 
12,24,84,DAWN,"Ash, did you say Battle Pyramid? "
12,24,85,BROCK,"Yeah, it was the final facility Ash challenged back in the Kanto Battle Frontier days! "
12,24,86,DAWN,"The Battle Frontier - That's, uh. "
12,24,87,BROCK,"It's a group of facilities somewhat like a Gym but more intense, where you challenge and battle against an amazing group of powerful Trainers called Frontier Brains! Brandon is the most powerful Kanto Frontier Brain, and everyone calls him the ""Pyramid King"". "
12,24,88,BROCK,"Reggie, didn't you challenge him too? "
12,24,89,BROCK,I remember seeing the Frontier Symbols on display in your house. 
12,24,90,REGGIE,"Yeah, but I never got the Brave Symbol which is proof of winning at the Battle Pyramid. "
12,24,91,ASH,"That's right, Brock told me. "
12,24,92,ASH,"So, why did you stop battling? "
12,24,93,REGGIE,Because I learned one thing. that I have a lot more to learn! 
12,24,94,BRANDON,What a nice surprise! 
12,24,95,REGGIE,"It's been much too long, Brandon! "
12,24,96,BRANDON,"Great to see so many familiar faces! If I remember, you're Reggie's younger brother right? "
12,24,97,PAUL,So you do remember me! I'd like to challenge you to a Pokémon Battle. Right here and now! 
12,24,98,ASH,Battle? 
12,24,99,DAWN,[SURPRISED] 
12,24,100,DODRIO,[EXERTION] 
12,24,101,CANDICE,Incredible! It's the real Battle Pyramid! 
12,24,102,ZOEY,Ms. Senior! 
12,24,103,CANDICE,And it's so huge! 
12,24,104,BRANDON,"Sorry to cause such a fuss but I'm Brandon, the Pyramid King of the Battle Frontier! "
12,24,105,CANDICE,"I'm honored to meet you! I'm Candice, the Snowpoint Gym Leader! "
12,24,106,BRANDON,"Oh it's you, Maria! "
12,24,107,MARIA,"We've been waiting for you, Pyramid King. "
12,24,108,BRANDON,I'd like to introduce you all! Everybody please say hello to Temple Maiden Maria! 
12,24,109,MARIA,It's an honor! 
12,24,110,BROCK,"With a beautiful maiden like you - I must make a pilgrimage to the Snowpoint Temple right away, or bust! "
12,24,111,CROAGUNK,[CROAKING] 
12,24,112,BROCK,"No fair, I haven't even left yet! "
12,24,113,DAWN,Zoey? There's a temple here? 
12,24,114,ZOEY,"Oh yeah, the Snowpoint Temple! "
12,24,115,ZOEY,"It's a bit far from here, but it's an ancient temple with a rich history! "
12,24,116,DAWN,That sounds awesome! 
12,24,117,MIME JR.,[EXCITED] 
12,24,118,JAMES,Temple she says! 
12,24,119,MEOWTH,Rich she says! 
12,24,120,JESSIE,"History's out, money's in! "
12,24,121,WOBBUFFET,[AGREEING] 
12,24,122,BRANDON,You see my purpose in coming to Sinnoh is to investigate the Snowpoint Temple! 
12,24,123,BROCK,Of course. You do research on many ancient civilizations right? 
12,24,124,BRANDON,Correct! 
12,24,125,MARIA,But I never imagined you were going to travel here in your amazing Battle Pyramid! 
12,24,126,BRANDON,"It appears we've caused a bit of a scene! Now, Sam. "
12,24,127,SAM,Sir! 
12,24,128,BRANDON,"Please, go on ahead with Maria to the temple! "
12,24,129,SAM,What about you? 
12,24,130,BRANDON,Take a look! 
12,24,131,BRANDON,Look into his eyes! 
12,24,132,BRANDON,How can I refuse the battle this young man requests? 
12,24,133,BRANDON,I'll catch up with you soon! 
12,24,134,MARIA,Thank you sir! 
12,24,135,REGGIE,"But Paul, why now? "
12,24,136,PAUL,Because I have to do what you couldn't! And that's that! 
12,24,137,ASH,"Hey, Brandon! It would be really great if you'd let us watch your battle! "
12,24,138,BRANDON,Young man? 
12,24,139,PAUL,I don't care. 
12,24,140,BROCK,Brandon! I could referee! 
12,24,141,PAUL,Why? There's no need! 
12,24,142,PAUL,It's a full six - on - six battle! Pokémon exchanges allowed! The battle will be over when all six of one side's Pokémon are unable to continue! 
12,24,143,BRANDON,Very well! 
12,24,144,ASH,Paul wants to do what Reggie couldn't. 
12,24,145,ASH,He's going to try and b*at Brandon! 
12,24,146,PAUL,Magmar! Stand by for battle! 
12,24,147,MAGMAR,[APPEARING] 
12,24,148,BRANDON,Regirock! I need your assistance! 
12,24,149,REGIROCK,[APPEARING] 
12,24,150,CANDICE,Regirock! 
12,24,151,POKEDEX,"Regirock. The Rock Peak Pokémon. Regirock's body is made of rock, and if something chips off in battle it attaches rocks to repair itself. "
12,24,152,PAUL,So Brandon starts with Regirock. Just like he did with my brother. 
12,24,153,REGGIE,I remember Paul was watching. Of course that was back when my Pokémon and I were defeated by Brandon. 
12,24,154,BROCK,[SURPRISED] 
12,24,155,REGGIE,Paul was a new Trainer and had just gotten his Turtwig. He had gone to Kanto during his Sinnoh journey. 
12,24,156,REGGIE,Because he wanted to watch my battle. 
12,24,157,REGGIE,"I had already gone from league to league, and I felt ready to challenge Kanto's Battle Frontier! "
12,24,158,REGGIE,"So, to become a Frontier Brain, I had one more challenge I needed to face, and that was a battle against Brandon! "
12,24,159,REGGIE,But. 
12,24,160,REGIROCK,[PAINED] 
12,24,161,REGGIE,We lost without defeating a single Pokémon. 
12,24,162,TURTWIG,[SHOCKED] 
12,24,163,BRANDON,No! You challenged me and I truly did enjoy our battle today. But the fact remains that your battling style is little more than standard ordinary fare! 
12,24,164,BRANDON,Now where is your true inner strength? 
12,24,165,PAUL,Wow! What about my inner strength? 
12,24,166,BROCK,So the reason Paul's so obsessed with power is because of what happened to Reggie! 
12,24,167,BRANDON,"All right, I can handle anything you bring! Because that's my battling style! "
12,24,168,PAUL,"Magmar, return! "
12,24,169,BRANDON,Return? 
12,24,170,ASH,What's with Paul? 
12,24,171,DAWN,They haven't even started! 
12,24,172,BROCK,Paul must have decided that his Fire -type Magmar wouldn't be strong enough against Brandon's Rock - type Regirock! 
12,24,173,PAUL,Hariyama! Stand by for battle! 
12,24,174,HARIYAMA,[APPEARING] 
12,24,175,POKEDEX,Hariyama. The Arm Thrust Pokémon. Hariyama can send a truck flying with its powerful arm thrusts. 
12,24,176,ZOEY,A Fighting - type. That's a good choice! 
12,24,177,BRANDON,Let's begin. Stone Edge now! 
12,24,178,REGIROCK,[STONE EDGE MOVE] 
12,24,179,PAUL,"Quick, block it! "
12,24,180,HARIYAMA,[EXERTION] 
12,24,181,PAUL,You know Rock - type moves won't have much effect on Hariyama! Is this a test? 
12,24,182,BRANDON,You'll have to see! 
12,24,183,PAUL,Arm Thrust! 
12,24,184,HARIYAMA,[ARM THRUST MOVE] 
12,24,185,REGIROCK,[EXERTION] 
12,24,186,BRANDON,Hold it down! 
12,24,187,PAUL,Oh no! 
12,24,188,BRANDON,"Now, Shock Wave! "
12,24,189,REGIROCK ,[SHOCK WAVE MOVE][PAINED] 
12,24,190,BROCK,[SURPRISED] 
12,24,191,BROCK,"Even after damage from the Arm Thrust, Regirock has that much power! "
12,24,192,HARIYAMA,[STRUGGLING] 
12,24,193,PAUL,Force Palm! 
12,24,194,BRANDON,Use Focus Punch!

12,24,201,PIKACHU,[AMAZED] 
12,24,202,JESSIE,I remember climbing this - happily hunting for untold treasure! 
12,24,203,MEOWTH,Let's do it again for the good times! 
12,24,204,JESSIE,"There was nothing good about the first time! Say, let's do a temple trek! "
12,24,205,MEOWTH,"By the time we finish traipsing to the temple, I'll be too old to remember why! "
12,24,206,JAMES,"Well, I suggest a battle between you two to decide our preferred course of evil action! "
12,24,207,MEOWTH,"Hey, don't you have an opinion? "
12,24,208,JAMES,"At the risk of bragging, nope! "
12,24,209,MIME JR,[SMUG] 
12,24,210,JAMES,[SHOCKED] 
12,24,211,JESSIE,"All right, the fate of our future plans is in our hands! "
12,24,212,MEOWTH,I've got paws! 
12,24,213,JESSIE,To the temple if I win! 
12,24,214,MEOWTH,To the Pyramid if I win! 
12,24,215,JESSIE,"Rock paper scissors, sh**t! "
12,24,216,JESSIE,Bet I make you look! 
12,24,217,PAUL,Electabuzz! Stand by for battle! 
12,24,218,ELECTABUZZ,[APPEARING] 
12,24,219,CANDICE,Why choose an Electric - type? 
12,24,220,ASH,Of course! It makes total sense Paul would do that! 
12,24,221,DAWN,[SURPRISED] 
12,24,222,PAUL,Brick Break! 
12,24,223,ELECTABUZZ,[BRICK BREAK MOVE] 
12,24,224,REGIROCK,[PAINED] 
12,24,225,ASH,I knew he was gonna use Brick Break too! 
12,24,226,REGGIE,Well Brandon's Regirock is a high - level Pokémon and Paul knows it! So of course he's got to use an att*ck that'll be a powerful match. 
12,24,227,BRANDON,"Stone Edge, go! "
12,24,228,REGIROCK,[STONE EDGE MOVE] 
12,24,229,PAUL,Protect!

12,24,235,ELECTABUZZ,[PAINED] 
12,24,236,ELECTABUZZ,[DAZED] 
12,24,237,ASH,I can't believe how easily he took out Paul's Electabuzz! 
12,24,238,PIKACHU,[AMAZED] 
12,24,239,BRANDON,"Good! Regirock, return! "
12,24,240,BROCK,After using Hyper Beam a Pokémon can't act right away so it's good he's making an exchange now! 
12,24,241,BRANDON,Registeel! I need your assistance! 
12,24,242,REGISTEEL,[APPEARING] 
12,24,243,POKEDEX,Registeel. The Iron Pokémon. Because Registeel's body has been tempered by underground pressure for thousands of years its body cannot be scratched.

12,24,254,PAUL,But how? 
12,24,255,REGGIE,It must've had an effect. But it's hanging in! 
12,24,256,BRANDON,Use Iron Head! 
12,24,257,REGISTEEL,[IRON HEAD MOVE] 
12,24,258,PAUL,Block it and then Will - O - Wisp!

12,24,263,DAWN,Where's the Will - O - Wisp? 
12,24,264,BROCK,Iron Head may cause opponents to flinch and then it prevents them from attacking! 
12,24,265,PAUL,"Now, Nidoking! Stand by for battle! "
12,24,266,NIDOKING,[APPEARING] 
12,24,267,POKEDEX,Nidoking. The Drill Pokémon. One swing of its mighty tail can snap a telephone pole as if it were nothing but a matchstick. 
12,24,268,DAWN,"Nidoking is a Poison - type but I thought Poison - type moves don't work on Steel - types, isn't that right? "
12,24,269,ZOEY,"That's true, but Nidoking is also a Ground - type whose moves are effective on Steel - types. We'll have to wait and see which moves he calls. "
12,24,270,BRANDON,Use fl*sh Cannon! 
12,24,271,REGISTEEL,[fl*sh CANNON MOVE]

12,24,289,BRANDON,"All right, what's wrong? And here I thought you wanted to b*at the man who defeated your brother! "
12,24,290,PAUL,The truth is it's only because you defeated Reggie that my victory over you will have meaning. The challenge you always present to Trainers to find their own strength - was something my brother wasn't able to do! 
12,24,291,PAUL,But I'm not like my brother! My will gives me strength! And now you'll see it first hand! 
12,24,292,BRANDON,No! All wrapped up in the past! But why then do you walk the Pokémon path in the first place? 
12,24,293,BRANDON,"Tell me, why do you battle? "

12,24,303,BROCK,Right! It increases defensive power! 
12,24,304,REGGIE,"Yeah, Paul wants to hang in there and look for a chance to counterstrike. "
12,24,305,BRANDON,Ice Beam go!

12,24,329,BROCK,Zap Cannon always paralyzes its target if it hits! 
12,24,330,ASH,Why isn't Paul switching? 
12,24,331,BRANDON,"Now, Regice, return! "

12,24,352,ASH,Paul lost. After all that! 
12,24,353,BRANDON,Young man! 
12,24,354,BRANDON,This Battle of yours. 
12,24,355,BRANDON,Was that your true battle? 
12,24,356,BRANDON,You've done an excellent job raising and training your Pokémon! But you allow your emotions to betray you on the b*ttlefield! 
12,24,357,BRANDON,We will battle again one day when you've learned to control them! 
12,24,358,JESSIE,"Rock, paper, scissors, sh**t! "

12,24,375,DAWN,"Bye bye, Zoey! Good luck! "
12,24,376,ASH,Take care! 
12,24,377,REGGIE,Hey Paul! Do you think there's any chance that you and Ash could treat us to a full battle at some point? 
12,24,378,ASH,Me and Paul? 
12,24,379,BRANDON,You two! Interesting idea! Let's set the time and place and agree to meet again! That's bound to be a battle guaranteed to raise the level of both of you - of that there can be no doubt! 
12,24,380,ASH,"Yeah, great! I'm in! "
12,24,381,PAUL,"I'm in, too. "
12,24,382,BROCK,"Reggie, what about the time and place? "
12,24,383,REGGIE,Exactly ten days from now. At the Pokémon Center near Lake Acuity! 
12,24,384,NARRATOR,"And so, one wonders what Paul has taken away from his battle with Brandon, and how that might affect the upcoming full battle between Ash and Paul! You'll need to stay tuned for the answer, and patiently wait ten days in the process! "
12,24,385,SAM,Brandon! 
12,24,386,MARIA,Something terrible has happened at the temple! 
12,24,387,BRANDON,Oh no
12,23,0,ASH,Yes! It's time! 
12,23,1,PIKACHU,[PSYCHED] 
12,23,2,DAWN,"Best of luck today, Ash! "
12,23,3,ASH,Thanks! 
12,23,4,ZOEY,Can't wait to see what kind of Battle it's going to be! 
12,23,5,NARRATOR,"With the fate of his seventh Sinnoh Gym Badge on the line, it's no wonder Ash is so excited, as our Heroes make their way over to the Snowpoint Gym, and its Gym Leader, Candice! Sometimes it's hard to know, Which way you're supposed to go. But deep inside, you know you're strong. If you follow your heart, you can't be wrong. Stand up! [Stand up!] For what is right. Be brave! Get ready to fight. Hold on! [Hold on!] We're friends for life. And if we come, together as one, Complete the quest, that we've begun, We will win the battle! Galactic Battles! Pokémon! Galactic Battles! Pokémon! "
12,23,6,DAWN,Wow! Awesome! I've never seen a Gym Battle on a field made of ice! 
12,23,7,PIPLUP,[THRILLED] 
12,23,8,ZOEY,So I wonder what Ash's strategy is going to be against Ms. Senior? MR. 
12,23,9,HONCHO,"May I have your attention! The Snowpoint Gym Battle with Ash the challenger, versus Gym Leader Candice will now begin! MR. "
12,23,10,HONCHO,"Four Pokémon for each side! This challenge will be completed when all four of one side's Pokémon are unable to Battle! Furthermore, only the challenger may exchange Pokémon during the Battle! "
12,23,11,CANDICE,Right! Let's Go! 
12,23,12,ZOEY,Wow! I've never seen Ms. Senior so pumped! 
12,23,13,BROCK,So the rule at this Gym is four on four. This Battle could end up a long one 
12,23,14,GIRL X  ,[HAPPY] 
12,23,15,JEREMIAH,"Come on people! Just because Candice and Mr. Honcho aren't here, doesn't mean it's playtime! Back to study hall! "
12,23,16,GIRL X  ,Yes sir 
12,23,17,MEOWTH,"Perfect! This time, do what I say and we'll cop lots of Pokémon! "
12,23,18,JESSIE,"So what's the plan, master? "
12,23,19,MEOWTH,The Gym Leader's out tussling with the Twerp so we bust into the Poké Ball storage room and swipe a slew of them! 
12,23,20,JAMES,That's your master plan? 
12,23,21,MEOWTH,"Tsk, tsk, tsk! Let us not forget the cool culprit always returns to the scene of the crime! "
12,23,22,JESSIE,"It's perfect! Since we tried and failed to fairly and squarely steal them first, it's the underhanded approach this time! "
12,23,23,MEOWTH,"You sure can poop a party, Jess. "
12,23,24,MEOWTH,This time it's success! 
12,23,25,JESSIE,I'll give that a yes! 
12,23,26,JAMES,Big money is my guess! 
12,23,27,JESSIE,So onward let us press! 
12,23,28,MEOWTH,There are enough Poké Balls in that room to give the Twerps some real distress! 
12,23,29,MEOWTH,This is progress! 
12,23,30,JAMES,Uh Guess they thought we culprits would return as well. 
12,23,31,JESSIE,This may insert a crimp into our plan. 
12,23,32,MEOWTH ,A plan's only as good as its back up! 
12,23,33,CANDICE,Let's show them some real kiai! Sneasel! 
12,23,34,SNEASEL,[APPEARING] 
12,23,35,ASH,"She's wasting no time using an Ice type, huh? Okay! Now, Grotle I choose you! "
12,23,36,GROTLE,[APPEARING] 
12,23,37,DAWN,Why is he using Grotle? 
12,23,38,ZOEY,Grass-type Pokémon are supposed to be at a disadvantage against Ice types 
12,23,39,CANDICE,"Hey! You like unpredictability don't you? I have no idea what your strategy is, but it sure is a lot of fun! "
12,23,40,ASH,"Okay Grotle it's time! Energy Ball, now! "
12,23,41,GROTLE,[ENERGY BALL MOVE] 
12,23,42,CANDICE,"Sneasel, dodge it, quick! "
12,23,43,SNEASEL,[DODGING]

12,23,47,SNEASEL,[ICY WIND MOVE] 
12,23,48,GROTLE,[CONFUSED] 
12,23,49,PIPLUP,[WORRIED] 
12,23,50,BROCK,Sneasel is already known to be really fast and here it's using the ice to move faster still! On top of that Icy Wind is far more effective at close range! 
12,23,51,GROTLE,[STRUGGLING] 
12,23,52,ASH,"Hey, hang in there Grotle! "
12,23,53,GROTLE,[RESOLUTE] 
12,23,54,DAWN,Why won't Grotle make a move? 
12,23,55,ZOEY,It can't endure that att*ck much longer that's for sure! 
12,23,56,BROCK,"Wait, I know "
12,23,57,CANDICE,"All right Sneasel, use Fury Swipes! "

12,23,72,ZOEY,Sure did 
12,23,73,PIPLUP,[THRILLED] 
12,23,74,BROCK,"While waiting for an opportunity to strike, Grotle stood there and took it! Ash took Paul and Torterra's strategy when they battled Gliscor and made it his own! "
12,23,75,ASH,"Grotle, that was some great work! Take a good rest! "
12,23,76,CANDICE,"Wow, Ash your kiai is strong! This is the kind of battle I like! Now get ready for this Medicham show us your kiai! "
12,23,77,MEDICHAM,[APPEARING] 
12,23,78,DAWN,"That's a Medicham, isn't it? "
12,23,79,POKEDEX,"Medicham. The Meditate Pokémon. Through a combination of food deprivation and meditation, Medicham gains the ability to see its opponent's aura. "
12,23,80,ASH,Medicham huh? All right! Okay Staraptor I choose you! 
12,23,81,STARAPTOR,[APPEARING] 
12,23,82,BROCK,Good choice! Ash's using his Flying-type Pokémon against Candice's Fighting-type Pokémon! They'll att*ck from the sky! 
12,23,83,CANDICE,"Oh, I see A bit more predictable this time "
12,23,84,JAMES,Puh-leeze! This is a master plan?! In case you didn't notice all we did was dig another hole! 
12,23,85,MEOWTH,Curb your tongue! Around this joint simplicity is beauty! 
12,23,86,JESSIE,Save the sermon and start swiping the Poké Balls! 
12,23,87,JAMES,Joy! It's Poké Ball picking season again! 
12,23,88,MEOWTH,Ripe and juicy and ready to be plucked!

12,23,101,BROCK,"Yeah! Even if Staraptor att*cks from the air, Medicham's Psychic-type moves make it hard! "
12,23,102,PIPLUP,[WORRIED] 
12,23,103,STARAPTOR,[STRUGGLING] 
12,23,104,ASH,You can do it Staraptor! Use Aerial Ace!

12,23,124,DAWN,"Wow, that's two straight wins for Ash! "
12,23,125,PIPLUP,[THRILLED] 
12,23,126,BROCK,His quick thinking to use Close Combat got him that win! 
12,23,127,ASH,"How's it going, Candice? You know I'm just getting warmed up "
12,23,128,CANDICE,"That was pretty impressive! But from here on out you're not going to have such an easy go of it! Show us your kiai, now Snover! "
12,23,129,SNOVER,[APPEARING] 
12,23,130,BROCK,It's a Snover!

12,23,189,CHIMCHAR,[APPEARING] 
12,23,190,BROCK,Looks like Ash is going to use his secret w*apon! 
12,23,191,DAWN,Yeah! Chimchar's a Fire-type Pokémon so it has the advantage over an Ice type like Snover! 
12,23,192,CANDICE,So you're finally going to use your Fire type! 
12,23,193,ASH,"You got it! Chimchar, go! "

12,23,205,BROCK,Candice blocked Chimchar's vision by countering Flamethrower with Icy Wind and creating a huge amount of steam! 
12,23,206,ZOEY,"Ms. Senior specializes in Ice types, so she knows exactly what to do against a type that has the advantage! "
12,23,207,SNOVER,[DETERMINED] 
12,23,208,ASH,"Stay calm, Chimchar! "
12,23,209,CHIMCHAR,[FOCUSED]

12,23,232,CANDICE,A wise move! So who's up next? 
12,23,233,ASH,"Abomasnow doesn't look like it's very fast. Staraptor's Aerial Ace should be able to cause a lot of damage in one swoop! Okay Staraptor, I choose you! "
12,23,234,STARAPTOR,[APPEARING] 
12,23,235,ASH,"Aerial Ace, go! "

12,22,77,ZOEY,I think Ms. Senior's telling me I need to battle! 
12,22,78,CANDICE,Bingo! But before we do that I want Zo Zo to see how good all my students are.how hard they work! You've got to remember your roots! 
12,22,79,ZOEY,The Pokémon Trainer School. 
12,22,80,ZOEY,".the place where you study the basics of handling your Pokémon up until the age of ten! Of course that's the main reason for the school's existence, but there's another course older students may take as well. "

12,22,82,ZOEY,It's a special course indeed! 
12,22,83,ZOEY,"Everyone here got their first Pokémon, but for one reason or another all these people had to interrupt their Pokémon journeys! "

12,22,97,COOK,Got to write this down! 
12,22,98,JAMES,His worn out sayings are more boring than he!

12,22,155,CANDICE,What kind of Pokémon is Cyndaquil? 
12,22,156,CANDICE,Mr. Jeremiah was the first!

12,22,168,CANDICE,Excellent! Right again! 
12,22,169,DAWN,Abra's twenty-four hours? What does that mean? 
12,22,170,JEREMIAH,"I think it goes something like this: An Abra will sleep for eighteen hours every day. Okay, now how long does the smell produced by a Stunky last? "
12,22,171,CANDICE,"Exactly right, Mister Jeremiah! "
12,22,172,ASH,"Whoa, talk about an awesome prediction! "
12,22,173,JEREMIAH,"So Ash, what did you think? "
12,22,174,BROCK,That guy's incredible! 
12,22,175,ZOEY,He must study really hard! 
12,22,176,JAMES,Never say die! 
12,22,177,JESSIE,All I need is a question I actually know. 
12,22,178,CANDICE,"Okay, next! Meowth's. "
12,22,179,CANDICE,.powerful move that only Meowth can learn is? 
12,22,180,MEOWTH,My brain burped! 
12,22,181,JAMES,Wait! I don't sense any trickery! That question is balanced and quite fair! 
12,22,182,CANDICE,Mister Jeremiah! First again! 
12,22,183,JEREMIAH,"Pay Day, Ma'am! "
12,22,184,CANDICE,And that's another correct answer! 
12,22,185,ASH,How does he do it? 
12,22,186,PIKACHU,[WORRIED] 
12,22,187,JESSIE,Excuse me genius! You're a Meowth. Why didn't you know? 
12,22,188,MEOWTH,"I'm dressed up as a person so I didn't want to blow my cover, capiche? "
12,22,189,PUNK,Excuse me? 
12,22,190,CANDICE,Yes what is it? 
12,22,191,PUNK,"This quiz is supposed to have something to do with battles, right? I came here to learn about battling. "
12,22,192,CANDICE,All right then. Class is there anybody else here who was wondering the same thing? 
12,22,193,CANDICE,"So! You see class my quick quiz was designed to help tune your reflexes razor-sharp! In a quiz or a battle, if you can learn to read a situation accurately it will work to your advantage! "
12,22,194,CANDICE,"When in a battle, your Pokémon actually does the battling, leaving all decisions to the Trainer! What we're doing here is classroom exercises that will help you become a Trainer your Pokémon can believe in! "
12,22,195,BROCK,I should know as an ex-Gym Leader! She's definitely telling it straight! 
12,22,196,ZOEY,That's my Ms. Senior! 
12,22,197,ASH,This stinks! 
12,22,198,BROCK,Relax! You simply show off your true power when you're in a Battle see? Desk-type work? That's really not your thing! 
12,22,199,PIKACHU,[REASSURING] 
12,22,200,JEREMIAH,I wondered about that! 
12,22,201,PIKACHU,[SURPRISED] 
12,22,202,ASH,Jeremiah! 
12,22,203,JEREMIAH,"For a Trainer with six badges, you don't seem to know that much. "
12,22,204,JEREMIAH,"To be honest, I'm surprised! "
12,22,205,ASH,"Hey, I'll do better next time! "
12,22,206,JEREMIAH,I would hope so. 
12,22,207,BROCK,"Don't worry! It doesn't change the fact that you're a genius at Gym Battles, really! "
12,22,208,ASH,Yeah maybe. Hey! Where's Dawn and the g*ng? 
12,22,209,PIPLUP,[HAPPY] 
12,22,210,ZOEY,Wow! It's still here! 
12,22,211,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
12,22,212,GLAMEOW,[SURPRISED] 
12,22,213,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
12,22,214,DAWN,So what is this place? 
12,22,215,CANDICE,What do you think it is? 
12,22,216,ZOEY,Ms. Senior! 
12,22,217,CANDICE,This is where it all started for Zo Zo and me. 
12,22,218,DAWN,Started? 
12,22,219,CANDICE,Right Dawn started! This is where Zo Zo and I raised Glameow together! 
12,22,220,ASH,Dawn! 
12,22,221,DAWN,Ash! Hey guys! 
12,22,222,CANDICE,"Okay, you know how stubborn Zo Zo is. "
12,22,223,ZOEY,Ms. Senior? 
12,22,224,CANDICE,"Well, with good reason! You know exactly what I mean, don't you Glameow? "
12,22,225,GLAMEOW,[SENTIMENTAL] 
12,22,226,ZOEY,I first met Glameow. 
12,22,227,ZOEY,.one super-cold morning when I was on my way to school! 
12,22,228,ZOEY,I just couldn't leave Glameow like that. 
12,22,229,ZOEY,.so I brought it back home! 
12,22,230,ZOEY,But my parents told me I couldn't have a Pokémon until I was a Trainer and to take Glameow to the Pokémon Center! 
12,22,231,ZOEY,So at that moment I decided to secretly raise Glameow.right here! 
12,22,232,ZOEY,"I made a promise to myself that when I became a Trainer, I would make Glameow my partner. "
12,22,233,DAWN,Wow.That's such an amazing story Zoey! 
12,22,234,GLAMEOW,[GRATEFUL] 
12,22,235,CANDICE,"She tried to keep it quiet, but Mr. Honcho found out right away! "
12,22,236,ZOEY,I refused to give it up. 
12,22,237,ZOEY,.and that's when Ms. Senior stepped in and stood up for me! 
12,22,238,CANDICE,"Eventually Mr. Honcho gave in, but it was on condition that both Zo Zo and I would be raising our dear Glameow! "
12,22,239,BROCK,Of course! That explains why Glameow is Zoey's number one partner! 
12,22,240,CANDICE,"Now don't tell me Zo Zo didn't give you an earful about not approving of Trainers that want to compete in both Gym Battles and Contests, right? "
12,22,241,ASH,I remember something about that! 
12,22,242,DAWN,Yeah at the Jubilife Contest where we first met her! 
12,22,243,PIKACHU,[REMEMBERING] 
12,22,244,CANDICE,"But as you can see, it's not always a bad thing to have a bit of a stubborn streak. "
12,22,245,ZOEY,Ms. Senior decided to put all her efforts into battling! 
12,22,246,ZOEY,.while I decided to enter Contests and become Top Coordinator! 
12,22,247,ZOEY,"You see in order to reach the very top, we promised each other we would concentrate on pursuing only one career path! Trainers that try to do both look like they're not taking it seriously! And Ms. Senior gets so mad and says it's doing way too much stuff! "
12,22,248,CANDICE,"""Too much is more than enough!"" you know! Tell me Dawn.You've got four Ribbons now right? "
12,22,249,DAWN,Right! Although I did just attempt to win my fifth Ribbon and I lost.But for some reason I feel relieved! 
12,22,250,CANDICE,Relieved? 
12,22,251,DAWN,Well since Zoey has four Ribbons like me it's almost like we're feeling the same inside! 
12,22,252,CANDICE,"The same? Look! You two are rivals now aren't you? You think you're gonna win with an attitude like that? Where is your ""kiai""? "
12,22,253,ASH,Yipes! 
12,22,254,PIKACHU,[WORRIED] 
12,22,255,BROCK,I suspected it during the quick quiz too .how intense she gets in a win or lose situation! I'll bet she really brings it in a Battle! 
12,22,256,ASH,Yeah! 
12,22,257,JAMES,You know recess time is playtime. 
12,22,258,JESSIE,I also know when people are resting. 
12,22,259,MEOWTH,That's when evil starts to squirm! 
12,22,260,WOBBUFFET,[PROUD] MR. 
12,22,261,HONCHO,Well then how is the special course going for you? 
12,22,262,MEOWTH,We're having a ball!

12,22,264,JAMES,I'll bet you have a veritable plethora of Pokémon! MR. 
12,22,265,HONCHO,Yes of course we do! 
12,22,266,MEOWTH,It'd be great to get the grand tour! MR. 
12,22,267,HONCHO,All right! Just follow me! MR. 
12,22,268,HONCHO,All of the Pokémon you see here are divided by their stage of evolution and by type as well! MR. 
12,22,269,HONCHO,Of course these Pokémon are the pride of our school! MR. 
12,22,270,HONCHO,We've got every type of Pokémon available to use for practice and in class.

12,22,283,HONCHO,Something's happened.Something terrible! 
12,22,284,JEREMIAH,"Stop, those aren't your Poké Balls and you know it! "
12,22,285,JESSIE,"Well, no sense them wallowing in school! "
12,22,286,JAMES,We'll take them. We rule! 
12,22,287,MEOWTH,You dopes can play the fool! 
12,22,288,JEREMIAH,I don't know who you are.but you're certainly not Trainers so I'll just have to take care of you myself! Skuntank let's go!

12,21,26,BROCK,"Well, cuteness isn't everything. "
12,21,27,MARILYN,"Now of course it is, they can't have evolved yet, must be no more than   feet talland most importantly look absolutely lovely. And that is my own system for - ranking cuteness. - "
12,21,28,ASH,Okay. 
12,21,29,DAWN,Here's Piplup. What do you think? 
12,21,30,PIPLUP,[PROUD] 
12,21,31,PIPLUP,[DISAPPOINTED] 
12,21,32,DAWN,"Come on, now. Don't you see Piplup hasn't evolved yet and is under two feet tall. So based on what you said, I think it fits your system to a tee! "
12,21,33,MARILYN,"Honestly? The head's shaped like a bowling ball, the beak is annoying, and its eyes look like mud pies! There's nothing cute at all going on there. "
12,21,34,PIPLUP,[SHOCKED]

12,21,47,JESSIE,"When it comes to cuteness, I know from where I speak! I'll be the judge of that! "
12,21,48,MEOWTH,"Well if that Poké-cutie's half as cute as that sqwawk box claims, we'll give it to the boss as a gift! "
12,21,49,BROCK,The battle will be one-on-one! - Is a single match okay? - 
12,21,50,MARILYN,Totally! -

12,21,68,GIOVANNI,I must reward that also cute Meowth and his friends too for cuteing me up when I was going down! 
12,21,69,MEOWTH,We'll be the richest Team Rocketeers around! -

12,21,73,JAMES,Me and my big mouth!! 
12,21,74,MARILYN,Now could any Pokémon be cuter than you Cherubi? 
12,21,75,CHERUBI,[HAPPY] 
12,21,76,BROCK,"Excuse me, Marilyn, but the battle's begun. "
12,21,77,MARILYN,"I just want to look at my cute Cherubi-poo a teeny little bit longer, so go ahead and att*ck Dawny! "
12,21,78,DAWN,"Fine then! Glad to help you out! Buneary, use Dizzy Punch! "
12,21,79,BUNEARY,[DIZZY PUNCH MOVE] 
12,21,80,CHERUBI,[YELP] 
12,21,81,MARILYN,That was the cutest fall I've ever seen! Awesome! 
12,21,82,DAWN,"Well if you're not going to att*ck, we'll move things right along with Ice Beam! "
12,21,83,BUNEARY,[ICE BEAM MOVE] 
12,21,84,MARILYN,Okay! Protect! 
12,21,85,CHERUBI,[PROTECT MOVE] 
12,21,86,ASH,It used Protect so the Ice Beam shouldn't have done a thing! 
12,21,87,MARILYN,The agony! No one can stand and take it any cuter than you! 
12,21,88,DAWN,"But, is that all you're thinking about? "
12,21,89,ASH,I don't even think Marilyn cares about battling! 
12,21,90,PIPLUP,[CURIOUS] 
12,21,91,PIKACHU,[CURIOUS] 
12,21,92,BROCK,"Hey, I think Cherubi's putting on an act! It shouldn't feel a thing while using Protect! If you're not going to battle properly, we'll stop! "
12,21,93,MARILYN,"This is just starting to get good, - so you stay out of this! - "
12,21,94,BROCK,Stay out of this? 
12,21,95,MARILYN,You have to since I'm sure today's Battle will be the world's most valiant Pokémon battle the world's ever seen! 
12,21,96,BROCK,The most valiant battle? 
12,21,97,MARILYN,"Uh huh! When I see a Pokémon taking an att*ck,it gets me right here in the heart! And then it gets me to feeling all warm and fuzzy inside! "
12,21,98,MARILYN,I simply don't know of anything that's more valiant than that is! It has to be the best thing ever! 
12,21,99,ASH,That's battling? It's nothing I've ever seen! 
12,21,100,MARILYN,"Ash, Pokémon battles are an art, and seeing a super-cute Pokémon stand up to an opponent's att*cks and still battle valiantly. That's what it's all about! Why this kind of ultimate battle is the most valiant experience one can have! It isn't just valiant, it's super-duper mega-mondo-colossal valiant! "
12,21,101,BROCK,You're being inappropriate! 
12,21,102,MARILYN,No! I am not! 
12,21,103,BROCK,"Look! In a Pokémon battle, competitors perform to their best of their abilities by battling fair and square! "
12,21,104,MARILYN,"You should watch what you're saying Brocky, you're sounding like an old geezer. "
12,21,105,BROCK,"Brocky? All right, the thing is you have to battle back, or this won't be a battle. So either you do what I say, or I'll have to disqualify you! Oh man! "
12,21,106,MARILYN,"I can't help it if he doesn't know what he's talking about, but I guess we have no choice. All right, Cherubi, time to battle back! "
12,21,107,CHERUBI,[EXCITED] 
12,21,108,MARILYN,Now. Use Magical Leaf! 
12,21,109,CHERUBI,[MAGICAL LEAF MOVE] 
12,21,110,DAWN,"Quick Buneary, dodge it! "
12,21,111,BUNEARY,[DETERMINED] / [GRUNT] 
12,21,112,DAWN,"No, Buneary! "
12,21,113,CHERUBI,[DETERMINED] - 
12,21,114,ASH,Buneary's down! - 
12,21,115,MARILYN,Now Tackle! 
12,21,116,CHERUBI,[DETERMINED] / [TACKLE MOVE] 
12,21,117,BUNEARY,[GRUNT] / [DETERMINED] 
12,21,118,DAWN,"Buneary, you can do it! Dizzy Punch! "
12,21,119,MARILYN,Dodge it valiantly! 
12,21,120,CHERUBI,[DETERMINED][ATTACKING] 
12,21,121,MARILYN,Solar Beam! 
12,21,122,CHERUBI,[SOLAR BEAM MOVE] 
12,21,123,BUNEARY,[PAINED] / [PANTING] 
12,21,124,DAWN,"Buneary, no! "
12,21,125,MARILYN,"Not only is Buneary mega-cute, but it battles way more valiantly than I thought! Now it's time to show me lots more of that valiant spunk! "
12,21,126,BUNEARY,[STRUGGLING] / [WEAK] 
12,21,127,BROCK,Buneary is unable to battle and that means the winners are Cherubi and Marilyn! 
12,21,128,MARILYN,"I wanted to see more of Buneary's valiant spirit, but instead I overdid it and now it won't be a valiant battle! "
12,21,129,DAWN,"Well, I'll say this: it was unique. "
12,21,130,ASH,Man what kind of battling was that? It looked like Marilyn couldn't have cared less whether she won the thing or lost it! 
12,21,131,BROCK,"So, does this mean that's all there is? No! This is not right! "
12,21,132,JAMES,"Meowth! That Pokémon is primed for poaching, so make up a machine, mush! "
12,21,133,MEOWTH,"With what dough? If my wallet was flatter, it'd need a back brace! "
12,21,134,JESSIE,We don't need a machine when all we need is a dollop of Pokémon cuteness! 
12,21,135,JAMES,"So we put forth one of our valiantly adorable Pokémon for battle and then b*at her at her own cutesy game! Carnivine, bring out that cute face! "
12,21,136,JAMES,"The face is cute, but are the teeth necessary? "
12,21,137,MEOWTH,"Big, green, and toothy ain't cute! "
12,21,138,JESSIE,Wait! What about Mime Jr.? 
12,21,139,MEOWTH,It's that kind of level-headed thinking that makes your critics wrong most of the time! 
12,21,140,MARILYN,Valiant battling can sure make a victorious girl hungry for lunch! 
12,21,141,JESSIRILYN,"Are you Marilyn, perchance? "
12,21,142,MARILYN,Yes! 
12,21,143,JESSIRILYN,Hi! My name's Jessirilyn! Let's battle! With my super-cute Pokémon! 
12,21,144,MARILYN,"Super-cute Pokémon!? Where, where? Where is it?! "
12,21,145,JESSIRILYN,"Come on out, cutie! "
12,21,146,MIME JR.,[HAPPY] / [PROUD] 
12,21,147,JESSIRILYN,Are we talking cute? 
12,21,148,MARILYN,"Okay, it hasn't evolved, and it isn't more than two feet tall, but that red nose is such a cute faux pas! It wouldn't ever make it onto my cute Pokémon list! "
12,21,149,MIME JR.,[SHATTERED] 
12,21,150,MARILYN,"Sorry, maybe some other time. "
12,21,151,JESSIRILYN,Well she's not on my list either. 
12,21,152,JAMES,Forgive me! I never should've let Jessie talk me into allowing you to be used as bait! 
12,21,153,MEOWTH,"Well, back to the old drawing board! "
12,21,154,DAWN,"Oh man, I don't think I'll ever understand that Marilyn! "
12,21,155,PIPLUP,[FRUSTRATED] 
12,21,156,ASH,I don't blame you! She sure does her own thing! 
12,21,157,BROCK,I've decided to battle her next! 
12,21,158,DAWN,Why? 
12,21,159,BROCK,"I can understand a Pokémon's cuteness being one of its strong points, but this just doesn't sit right with me! I don't want Marilyn to judge a Pokémon based on its looks! What's important is the bond created between Pokémon and Trainer! And when that's accomplished, any Pokémon can shine as brightly as possible! "
12,21,160,DAWN,"Wow, you're so right! Now you go set that Marilyn straight! "
12,21,161,BROCK,Yes! I will! 
12,21,162,SUDOWOODO,[PROUD] 
12,21,163,CROAGUNK,[CALM] / [ANNOYED] 
12,21,164,MARILYN,Me? Battle against them? 
12,21,165,BROCK,That's right. Take your pick! 
12,21,166,DAWN,"Excuse me Brock, don't you think you're pushing it a little bit? "
12,21,167,ASH,"Yeah, Marilyn didn't even think Piplup was that cute, remember? "
12,21,168,BROCK,"Hey! As far as I'm concerned, both Sudowoodo and Croagunk are as cute as they can be! "
12,21,169,DAWN,Right. I know just what Brock means! 
12,21,170,MARILYN,Nope! No can do! Don't you have any other Pokémon that are cute? 
12,21,171,BROCK,I do have another one. 
12,21,172,MARILYN,Great! I knew you had a cutie in there! 
12,21,173,BROCK,But this Pokémon hasn't even participated in any battles yet! 
12,21,174,MARILYN,"Well, I can already tell that this Pokémon's super cute! C'mon, show me Brocky! "
12,21,175,BROCK,All right. 
12,21,176,HAPPINY,[HAPPY] 
12,21,177,MARILYN,"Wow! It hasn't evolved yet and isn't more than two feet tall and is super, mega cute!! Aww.I'll battle with you! "
12,21,178,BROCK,"Your call, Happiny! Wanna battle Marilyn? "
12,21,179,HAPPINY,[EXCITED] 
12,21,180,BROCK,Happiny's in! But I want Sudowoodo and Croagunk in there too! Let's have three matches! 
12,21,181,MARILYN,I guess so. That's okay with me! 
12,21,182,JAMES,"Ahem, ref for hire! Get your official Ref! I'm an official Pokémon Center Battle Referee! - Anyone need a ref? - "
12,21,183,MARILYN,"What perfect timing! Would you be the Referee for our Pokémon battle, please Sir? "
12,21,184,JAMES,Thought you'd never ask! Sure! 
12,21,185,JESSIE,Just like clockwork! As soon as her cute Pokémon are pooped out. we move in! 
12,21,186,JAMES,All right! This will be a three-round battle with no Pokémon substitutions! So! Battle.begin! 
12,21,187,MARILYN,"Cherubi! Come out, cutely! "
12,21,188,BROCK,Sudowoodo let's go! 
12,21,189,CHERUBI,[APPEARING] 
12,21,190,SUDOWOODO,[APPEARING] 
12,21,191,BROCK,"Double-Edge, go! "
12,21,192,CHERUBI,[PAINED] 
12,21,193,MARILYN,Valiant! 
12,21,194,BROCK,Will you stop getting excited over your Pokémon's taking damage? 
12,21,195,BROCK,A battle is supposed to connect the hearts of a Trainer and their Pokémon! 
12,21,196,MARILYN,Oh Brocky! Geezer time. 
12,21,197,BROCK,"Well if words can't convince you, I'll just have to show you! Sudowoodo, use Mimic! "
12,21,198,SUDOWOODO,[MIMICK MOVE] 
12,21,199,SUDOWOODO,[DISTRESSED] 
12,21,200,BROCK,Use Fake Tears too! 
12,21,201,SUDOWOODO,[FAKE TEARS MOVE] 
12,21,202,BROCK,Isn't that valiant? 
12,21,203,MARILYN,It is! I'll give you two hundred points! 
12,21,204,BROCK,"Now you see, this proves every Pokémon is cute and has and valiant side too! "
12,21,205,MARILYN,You're right! Very valiant-Although in the cute department I'd give it a zero points out of ten! 
12,21,206,ASH,"Well, she got part of it, but I still can't figure that girl out! "
12,21,207,DAWN,Okay Referee do something about this! 
12,21,208,JAMES,"Yes, Ma'am! I guess we need to see what other Pokémon the girl has. Since this match is going nowhere fast, I hereby declare it a tie! "
12,21,209,BROCK,Sudowoodo return! 
12,21,210,MARILYN,"Cherubi, return valiantly! - "
12,21,211,JAMES,"Now, round two, begin! - "

12,21,213,MARILYN,Chingling! Come out.cutely! 
12,21,214,CHINGLING,[APPEARING] 
12,21,215,DAWN,"Boy, I can see why Marilyn has that one! "
12,21,216,PIKACHU,[SURPRISED] 
12,21,217,JESSIE,"And, the cuteness just keeps on coming. "
12,21,218,MEWOTH,Bet the third one makes me sick! 
12,21,219,BROCK,"Quick Croagunk, Poison Jab! "
12,21,220,CROAGUNK,[POISON JAB MOVE] 
12,21,221,CHINGLING,[PAINED] 
12,21,222,BROCK,"Now, Poison Sting! "
12,21,223,CROAGUNK,[POISON STING MOVE] 
12,21,224,CHINGLING,[PAINED] -

12,21,226,BROCK,Now Brick Break! 
12,21,227,CROAGUNK,[BRICK BREAK MOVE] 
12,21,228,CHINGLING,[CRYING OUT] 
12,21,229,MARILYN,"It's just like a fairy tale! Beauty battling the big, bad beast! "
12,21,230,DAWN,Will you stop goofing around and start battling?! 
12,21,231,MARILYN,"Pish-posh! Whatever. Chingling, att*ck valiantly for me using Growl! "
12,21,232,CHINGLING,[GROWL MOVE]

12,21,239,CROAGUNK,[STRUGGLING] 
12,21,240,BROCK,"Get up! You can do it, Croagunk! "

12,21,243,CROAGUNK,[STRUGGLING] / [DETERMINED] 
12,21,244,MARILYN,So valiant. 
12,21,245,BROCK,"Now you see? When a Trainer and their Pokémon's hearts truly unite and become one, any Pokémon regardless of their looks is valiant! "
12,21,246,JAMES,"All right, on with the match! "
12,21,247,BROCK,Use Brick Break! 
12,21,248,CROAGUNK,[BRICK BREAK MOVE]

12,21,250,JAMES,Chingling is unable to battle! Croagunk gets the win! 
12,21,251,MARILYN,"Chingling, return valiantly! "
12,21,252,BROCK,"Croagunk, return too! Thanks for battling so hard! "
12,21,253,BROCK,Do you see? The important thing is the bond between a Trainer and their Pokémon! 
12,21,254,MARILYN,"Brocky, geezer time! But I admit I hear you now. "
12,21,255,DAWN,I think Marilyn's changing her attitude! 
12,21,256,JAMES,"With Marilyn's first and second Pokémon as cute as buttons, her third Pokémon must register completely off of the cute chart! And now time for the third and final round! "
12,21,257,JESSIE,Get ready for a cute Pokémon to end all cute Pokémon! 
12,21,258,MEOWTH,I'm ready to melt! 
12,21,259,MARILYN,"Time out, just a sec! "
12,21,260,DAWN,What's going on? 
12,21,261,MARILYN,I'm going to use you! I'm back! I've never ever used this Pokémon in a battle before. But now I think it's a great idea! 
12,21,262,BROCK,What do you mean by that? 
12,21,263,MARILYN,"Okay, I've always thought this Pokémon was the cutest ever. People used to tease me all the time about how weird they thought I was for thinking that way! So after that I've been wrapped up in catching Pokémon that I knew everyone would think are cute as well! You see? "
12,21,264,BROCK,I see it now. 
12,21,265,MARILYN,"But Brocky, you taught me that it doesn't matter what people think! Now, my darling, come out cutely! "
12,21,266,SHELLDER,[APPEARING]

12,21,269,MARILYN,This is hands-down my most mega - cutest Pokémon! Don't you think Shellder's tongue is the most charming thing ever? 
12,21,270,ASH,I wonder if Brock really got in there after all! 'Course after all this I'm not so sure. 
12,21,271,DAWN,I'm sure she gets it even if just a little! 
12,21,272,BROCK,"Shellder, huh? That hard shell gives it a powerful defense! If this gets drawn out, it's going to be one tough battle! All right, Happiny! Let's go! "
12,21,273,BROCK,Happiny! I know this's your first Battle! I'm counting on you! 
12,21,274,MARILYN,"Let's win this for sure, Shellder! "
12,21,275,JESSIE,Down we go! Excuse us!

12,21,277,JESSIE,Please. If you think the Boss is gonna swing with a - Shellder you're nuts! - 
12,21,278,MARILYN,And who are you two? 
12,21,279,DAWN,They're part of Team Rocket and they're bad guys who steal people's Pokémon! 
12,21,280,MEOWTH,"Since Cherubi and Chingling are the cuties, - we'll steal them! - "
12,21,281,JAMES,Here they are! 
12,21,282,MARILYN,What's a referee doing in my purse? 
12,21,283,ASH,"He's one of Team Rocket, too! "
12,21,284,MEOWTH,"Not a great entrance, but what an exit. "
12,21,285,JESSIE,.Stage right! 
12,21,286,MARILYN,Shellder quick! Use Brine to catapult yourself! 
12,21,287,SHELLDER,[BRINE MOVE]

12,21,291,BROCK,"Happiny, use Pound! Go! "
12,21,292,HAPPINY,[POUND MOVE] 
12,21,293,JAMES,Why do things end up like this when we're much more valiant than the Twerps? 
12,21,294,MEWOTH,Tell them that! 
12,21,295,JESSIE,Least I'm the mega-cutest! - 
12,21,296,JAMES,Mega-looniest! - 
12,21,297,JESSIE,Not cool. 
12,21,298,MARILYN,"Great! Wow, thanks Shellder! You're the mega mega mega mega mega cutest! "
12,21,299,BROCK,"Looks like we finally got through to her. Although beauty is in the eye of the beholder, a Pokémon's cute appearance isn't what's important! "
12,21,300,DAWN,It was hard to be honest with herself after being really hurt by all those things her friends said! 
12,21,301,ASH,Any Pokémon can be cute for sure! 
12,21,302,PIKACHU,[ENTHUSED] 
12,21,303,PIPLUP,[ENTHUSED]

12,21,307,DAWN,"It's from my mom! ""I'm sure Snowpoint City will be cold so I thought I'd send you a little something to help keep you warm as well as something for Ash and Brock too!"" Hear that? "
12,21,308,ASH,Whoa! 
12,21,309,DAWN,So? 
12,21,310,MARILYN,Wow! You guys look so mega cute! 
12,21,311,NARRATOR,"And so, not only have our heroes reaffirmed the importance of the bond between Trainer and Pokémon, they're ready for the cold temperatures of Snowpoint City! Ash's next Sinnoh Gym Battle is close at hand, so stay tuned"
12,20,0,NARRATOR,"Following Dawn's Sandalstraw Pokémon Contest, our heroes have decided to stay in Sandalstraw Town for some Pokémon Ping Pong! "

12,20,3,ASH,Huh? 
12,20,4,DAWN,"Guys? Not to slow you champs down, but I don't really even understand the rules of Pokémon Ping Pong! "
12,20,5,BARRY,So I'll tell you! Okay first of all you have a Pokémon and its Trainer that form a team and while only the trainer is allowed to use a Ping Pong paddle his or her Pokémon is allowed to use a part of its body instead! 
12,20,6,DAWN,Is that it? 
12,20,7,BARRY,Well other than the fact that the Trainer always serves that's really about it! First team with eleven points wins the game.first team to win three games wins the match! 
12,20,8,DAWN,"Cool! Okay, I'm going to enter too! - "
12,20,9,BARRY,Now you're talking! - 
12,20,10,ASH,"So, let's do it! Sometimes it's hard to know, Which way you're supposed to go. But deep inside, you know you're strong. If you follow your heart, you can't be wrong. Stand up! [Stand up!] For what is right. Be brave! Get ready to fight. Hold on! [Hold on!] We're friends for life. And if we come, together as one, Complete the quest, that we've begun, We will win the battle! Galactic Battles! Pokémon! "
12,20,11,EMPLOYEE A [FEMALE],"Now just write your name in here, along with the Pokémon you're going to be teaming up with! "
12,20,12,EMPLOYEE A,"After you turn in your paperwork, you're registered! "
12,20,13,ASH,Great! And thanks for everything! 
12,20,14,ASH,'Course be Right bud?

12,20,20,DAWN,"Then that means we'll be able to get in plenty of practice, Ambipom! "
12,20,21,AMBIPOM,[EXCITED] 
12,20,22,ASH,"So Dawn, since there's not much time until the competition how about a practice match to warm things up? "
12,20,23,DAWN,Sure You're on! So call it heads or tails? 
12,20,24,ASH,I call heads! 
12,20,25,ASH,Yes! All right! We serve first!

12,20,36,DAWN,"Well, actually, if you really wanna know, this is our very first time! "
12,20,37,O,Impressive! It's great to see new teams involved. I would say the main thing is don't worry about making mistakes and do - your best! Have fun! -

12,20,43,ASH,So it's tournament style huh? Dawn that means if we both win in the first round; we get to go up against each other! 
12,20,44,DAWN,Then I'll see you in round two! 
12,20,45,ASH,Right! 
12,20,46,BARRY,"Well, I won't be running into either of you unless you somehow make it into the semifinals. Of course we'll be fine, but for you guys that's impossible! "
12,20,47,DAWN,We'll see about that! Look! 
12,20,48,DAWN,See that's the guy from before! 
12,20,49,BARRY,"Guy?! Excuse me folks, but for your information that guy is none other than O! He's last year's winner, with a rep of being the strongest ever! And the fans really respect him because he searches high and low for strong trainers and Pokémon to help spread the good word on Pokémon Ping Pong and he does it all over the world! "
12,20,50,ASH,Who knew? Sounds like a cool guy all right! 
12,20,51,BARRY,"He's cool all right, but we're gonna b*at that cool guy and show him who's the strongest! Now please try and - give it all you've got, okay? - "

12,20,56,BROCK,Hello! I was just wondering if you have any friends competing today. 
12,20,57,JAMES,"Saved by sleight of hand! Funny you should ask, since a chum of mine who's never even played a single game of Ping Pong is, in fact, competing today! My heart's going pitter pat! "
12,20,58,BROCK,"So is mine! My friends are actually beginners as well, and I'm just so anxious! "

12,20,75,JESSILYNLYN,Please! Please note that Marowak over there is holding a bone! 
12,20,76,JUDGE  ,According to the official rules that Marowak's bone is allowed. 
12,20,77,JESSILYNLYN,"Well, mister. Your rules aren't fair! Don't hurt the hair! What's up? "
12,20,78,MEOWTH,I don't need a stinking paddle! I'll slice and dice any dish they serve up! 
12,20,79,JESSILYNLYN,"Since a genius like me needs some kind of handicap, I agree with your rules! "
12,20,80,JUDGE  ,"Well, genius or not, the rules apply to everyone. "
12,20,81,EMCEE'S VOICE,"Each table, toss a coin to decide who serves first! "

12,20,87,JESSILYNLYN,"That's slice and dice, not ""slice and dice!"" "
12,20,88,MEOWTH,Next time I take Jess literally somebody stop me! 
12,20,89,JUDGE  ,"Since the Jessilynlyn/Meowth team used a move, you're out, according to the rules! "
12,20,90,JAMES,I'm doomed! 
12,20,91,BROCK,"So, the guy with the Farfetch'd is well -known too then is he. "

12,20,124,JESSILYNLYN,Look! We lost in the first round and it's your fault! 
12,20,125,MEOWTH,"""I'm sorry"" is supposed to take care of that. "
12,20,126,JESSILYNLYN,We'll have to grab the golden Ping Pong balls by force! Quick! Make a robot. 
12,20,127,MEOWTH,Yeah? With what? Our bank account's as empty as a Twerp's head!

12,20,146,ASH,"Yeah, those two are looking great! "
12,20,147,JAMES,Though it's Ambipom who's making it all possible. 
12,20,148,JESSILYNLYN,My current circumstance would be much different if I had made Aipom mine when we won the festival contest! I'd be down in the winner's circle instead of sitting up here with a sap like you! 
12,20,149,MEOWTH,"""Sorry"" ain't what it used to be. "
12,20,150,EMCEE,"Our two hard-working newcomers Dawn and Ambipom have made it from the A Block all the way up to this point! But while they take a well-deserved breather, up next we've got Barry and Empoleon versus O and Shiftry! "

12,20,230,ASH,What's important is what Ambipom wants to do! 
12,20,231,BROCK,"But there's a choice the Trainer needs to make! Between what a Pokémon wants and what's best for them. Part of your responsibility, see? "
12,20,232,DAWN,Thanks Brock; you're right! 
12,20,233,DAWN,Mister O? 
12,20,234,O,"Well, hi there, Dawn! "
12,20,235,DAWN,"I thought a lot about what you asked me last night, and I've decided the best thing is to let Ambipom figure out what it wants to do! "

12,18,66,BARRY,"Yeah, Kenny's right! Great job, Dawn! "
12,18,67,BARRY,"I'll tell you, the evolutionary road from Piplup to Empoleon only gets harder and harder, you just mark my words! "
12,18,68,KENNY,"And compared to Piplup, Prinplup's twice as big! Which gives you twice as much of a chance "
12,18,69,KENNY,"to show off what you've got in a contest, of course! "
12,18,70,ASH,"You're going to have to change the way you do battle, Dawn. Remember, with Grotle, it was the exact same thing for me! "

12,18,97,DAWN,"That was Bide. Piplup, why do you keep on doing that? "
12,18,98,DAWN,"See, if you evolve into Prinplup, then you'll get bigger and be able to learn all sorts of amazing new moves! "
12,18,99,DAWN,"And then we'll be able to win more contests, and. "

12,18,113,ASH,What makes sense? 
12,18,114,BROCK,"Piplup wanted nothing to do with evolving, which is why it's using Bide! "
12,18,115,ASH,For sure? Whoa! 
12,18,116,BROCK,And Piplup's been at this for a while. That's why Piplup's been using up so much energy!

12,18,259,MEOWTH,I dig where Piplup's coming from! I always wanted to protect the Boss by keeping that pompous Persian mucho miles away! 
12,18,260,DAWN,I get it now. That's why you've been using Bide so you wouldn't evolve.

12,18,291,JESSIE,"Stop! If it wants to evolve, let the poor thing evolve! "
12,18,292,JESSIE,"We can head this heist into an Empoleon triple play! And if we were to give three tops of the Evolution heap to the Boss, he'd be so giddy he'd give us the shirt off his back! "

12,13,162,BROCK, wonder if the strange coloring on a rare Metagross like that has anything to do with therocky mountain's environment? 
12,13,163,JAMES,A rare find like that could wind upmaking me a fortune! I'll just catch and gift thatoff-color Pokémon to the Boss!

12,12,102,MEOWTH,"Then Froslass toldme it's been trying to find its good buddy Snoruntfor the longest time. But no matter how muchit looks for its buddy, it comes up empty-handed,so I'm being held hostage while Jessie and James gohave a look for the little guy. "
12,12,103,DAWN,"Snorunt, huh? Let's see. "

12,11,70,JENNY,"I was transferred herefrom Kanto a short while ago and subsequentlyreceived word that Team Rocket had begun operations inthe Sinnoh region as well. And since Ash appearsto encounter Team Rocket quite frequently, I'm hereto ask him for his help. "
12,11,71,ASH,"Well, Team Rocket keepson chasing after me for sure. See, they're after my Pikachu. "
12,11,72,JENNY,This is thePikachu I've heard about. 
12,11,73,JENNY,There's nothingparticularly remarkable I can see. 
12,11,74,ASH,"Pikachu, knock it off!Oh, man! "

12,11,82,ASH,So this is howa bowling pin feels. 
12,11,83,DAWN,I'd sure like to know howthis is going to help her out. 
12,11,84,PIPLUP,[CONFUSED]

12,10,33,PACHIRISU,[SUPER FANG MOVE] 
12,10,34,GABITE,[ANNOYED] 
12,10,35,PACHIRISU,[GRUMPY] 
12,10,36,DAWN,That had to have been a new move! 
12,10,37,BROCK,Sure was. That was Super Fang! 
12,10,38,ASH,Getting mad about that Poffin must've made it happen. 
12,10,39,URSULA,What's wrong with that Pachirisu? 
12,10,40,PACHIRISU,[GROWLING] 
12,10,41,DAWN,"Come on Pachirisu, play nice. "
12,10,42,PACHIRISU,[ATTACKING] 
12,10,43,URSULA,"I must say, someone didn't do a very good job raising that Pachirisu. Right, Gabite? "
12,10,44,GABITE,[SMUG] 
12,10,45,ASH,"Gabite, let's see. "
12,10,46,POKEDEX,"Gabite. The Cave Pokemon. Gabite goes wild for precious jewels, first digging them up and then stashing them in its nest. "
12,10,47,DAWN,If you'll look under Gabite's foot you'll understand. 
12,10,48,URSULA,All right. 
12,10,49,GABITE,[SHOWING] 
12,10,50,URSULA,The horror! My beautiful Gabite's been soiled! How dare you! 
12,10,51,DAWN,Uhh. Sorry we soiled your Gabite. Go ahead and say you're sorry. 
12,10,52,ASH,"See, that's Pachirisu's favorite food, so, when Gabite stepped on it... "
12,10,53,URSULA,"If that's all this is about, I can help you. No Pokemon can resist my Poffins. "

12,10,57,DAWN,"Please, I wouldn't want you to get the wrong idea! "
12,10,58,BROCK,I'm sure you're aware of how Poffin recipes vary for different Pokémon. 
12,10,59,PIPLUP,[ASSURING] 
12,10,60,URSULA,"That Piplup. Hey, you competed in the last Wallace Cup Contest, didn't you? "
12,10,61,DAWN,"Me? I did! I mean, we did. "
12,10,62,URSULA,"Thought so! Yeah, I still really think your winning that Contest was a total accident. "
12,10,63,DAWN,"So tell me. Were you in the Wallace Cup, too? "
12,10,64,URSULA,"Well, I was there. The name's Ursula. Of course, since I was eliminated in the first round, - you wouldn't remember me. - "
12,10,65,JESSIE,I've got it! 
12,10,66,JESSIE,At the Wallace Cup! 
12,10,67,JESSIE,"She was an early round elimination, the poor angry loser of a dear. "
12,10,68,URSULA,That's it! I won't say a thing about it again! Though I'll never believe they let someone like you win. 
12,10,69,ASH,Hey look! Dawn's skills are why she won that contest! - How dare you say that! - 
12,10,70,URSULA,You're right! 
12,10,71,URSULA,"Thanks to her I started working doubly hard to become an even better, more beautiful, more graceful Coordinator! "
12,10,72,URSULA,"You know, I should thank you for defeating me, Dawn! Because of you, I am where I am today. "
12,10,73,BROCK,What's with her? Why won't she drop it? 
12,10,74,ASH,Yeah. 
12,10,75,URSULA,"Dawn dear, you have how many ribbons? - "
12,10,76,DAWN,I've got three of them. - 
12,10,77,URSULA,"Huh! The same as me. I guess you'll be in the Chocovine Contest? I can't wait to see what kind of ""graceful"" moves you've been working on. "
12,10,78,DAWN,"Back off! You think after what you said, I believe anything you say? We'll settle this at the contest! "
12,10,79,URSULA,Ooh! Want a battle? Then you have got a battle! But you won't win twice! 
12,10,80,JAMES,Let's start the Coordinator feud! 
12,10,81,MEOWTH,"Jess, this could be your big chance! "
12,10,82,JESSIE,My thought as well! Just let those Twerpettes knock each other on their Twerpish tails! While I stand with the grand prize! 
12,10,83,JAMES,Bravo Jess! How wise! 
12,10,84,MEOWTH,You'll knock them down to size! 
12,10,85,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE]

12,10,91,MARIAN,Here's what our winning Coordinator will receive. The beautiful and coveted Chocovine Ribbon! 
12,10,92,MARIAN,"And up next! I'm pleased to introduce our esteemed panel of contest judges. First the chief of the Pokémon Activities Committee, - Mr. Contesta! - "
12,10,93,CONTESTA,"Thank you Marian. I'm eager to see what will be nothing but spectacular Pokémon today, I'm sure! "
12,10,94,MARIAN,"Next, the head of the Pokémon Fan Club, Mr. Sukizo! "
12,10,95,SUKIZO,Chocovine Town is remarkable!

12,10,107,BUNEARY,[PROUD] 
12,10,108,MARIAN,And Buneary's made an ice slide to remember! 
12,10,109,ASH,Yes! Way to go! 
12,10,110,BUNEARY,[SLIDING] 
12,10,111,DAWN,Let's keep it going! Use Dizzy Punch now! 
12,10,112,BUNEARY,[DIZZY PUNCH MOVE] 
12,10,113,BUNEARY,[PROUD] 
12,10,114,ASH,"Wow, that's showing them! "
12,10,115,CONTESTA,Buneary's unique qualities were shown in a most appealing way... 
12,10,116,SUKIZO,That's true! Remarkable as well. 
12,10,117,JOY,They put together a host of techniques to make a great show. 
12,10,118,URSULA,Just like I thought. Least her attitude was good. 
12,10,119,JESSILINA,"Oh dear. Rather brusque, aren't we? "
12,10,120,MARIAN,Now. It's on with the show! 
12,10,121,DUSKULL,[APPEARING]

12,10,125,MARILL,[ATTACKING] 
12,10,126,MARIAN,Now. Time for our next Coordinator! 
12,10,127,JESSILINA,I know it's a thrill for you to see me too! 
12,10,128,JESSILINA,"Yanmega, let's get this party started! "
12,10,129,YANMEGA,[APPEARING] 
12,10,130,JAMES,Yanmega's primed and poised! 
12,10,131,MEOWTH,Keep primed and poisoned! 
12,10,132,JESSILINA,"Yanmega, Silver Wind! "
12,10,133,YANMEGA,[SILVER WIND MOVE] 
12,10,134,MARIAN,And Yanmega begins spinning a powerful Silver Wind! 
12,10,135,JAMES,Wow. There's some windy wind. 
12,10,136,YANMEGA,[ATACKING] 
12,10,137,YANMEGA,[INCREASING] 
12,10,138,MARIAN,Now that's fast! Could this be Yanmega's legendary Speed Boost in action? 
12,10,139,MARIAN,And off she goes spinning like a top! 
12,10,140,BROCK,She's really showing off Yanmega well. 
12,10,141,JESSILINA,Now Yanmega. It's time to use Sonic Boom! 
12,10,142,YANMEGA,[SONIC BOOM MOVE] 
12,10,143,JESSILINA,Next Silver Wind! 
12,10,144,YANMEGA,[SILVER WIND MOVE] 
12,10,145,JESSILINA,They're loving it! And you look fab! 
12,10,146,YANMEGA,[PLEASED] 
12,10,147,CONTESTA,It's rare to see a Coordinator's moves used to show off her Pokémon's qualities. 
12,10,148,SUKIZO,It's true! Which means remarkable! 
12,10,149,JOY,"Jessilina took some risks, and they paid off. "
12,10,150,MARIAN,Let's see what our next Coordinator's got for us! 
12,10,151,URSULA,You haven't seen anything yet! 
12,10,152,URSULA,"Now Wormadam, let's go! "
12,10,153,WORMADAM,[EMERGING] 
12,10,154,ASH,"Wormadam, huh? "
12,10,155,BROCK,"That Wormadam can use Ground-type moves. I've even heard it called the ""Sandy Cloak"". "
12,10,156,URSULA,"Wormadam start with Confusion! And next, use Rock Blast! "
12,10,157,MARIAN,"Moves like Rock Blast really show what makes it the ""worm of the desert!"" "
12,10,158,URSULA,GREAT! Sandstorm now! 
12,10,159,WORMADAM,[PREPARING] / [SANDSTORM MOVE] 
12,10,160,JESSILINA,Blah. I'm slightly impressed. 
12,10,161,DAWN,"Simple, but captivating too. "
12,10,162,URSULA,Confusion! 
12,10,163,WORMADAM,[CONFUSION MOVE] 
12,10,164,ASH,Whoa what was that? 
12,10,165,BROCK,Looks like they've worked on Confusion a lot. 
12,10,166,MARIAN,What a surprise! Wormadam's used that Sand Storm to make a sculpture of itself out of sand! 
12,10,167,URSULA,Wrap it up with Captivate! 
12,10,168,WORMADAM,[CAPTIVATE MOVE] 
12,10,169,MARIAN,An amazing way to end an amazing routine! 
12,10,170,CONTESTA,"There are three types of Wormadam of course, but that excellent performance put the ""worm of the desert"" front and center! An amazing sight to see. "
12,10,171,SUKIZO,"Amazing, also remarkable! "
12,10,172,JOY,It seemed like they had synchronized their breathing. I completely loved it. 
12,10,173,MARIAN,That's it! The end of the first stage! And the next order of business is see who will be in Round Two. 
12,10,174,MARIAN,Hang tight everyone! Back with the results soon! 
12,10,175,DAWN,"So g*ng, what'd you think? "
12,10,176,BUNEARY,[HAPPY] 
12,10,177,PACHIRISU,[HAPPY] 
12,10,178,PIPLUP,[HAPPY] 
12,10,179,PIKACHU,[HAPPY] 
12,10,180,ASH,"Wow, no one's cuter than you, Buneary! "
12,10,181,BUNEARY,[PLEASED] 
12,10,182,DAWN,What about you Mamoswine? What'd you think? 
12,10,183,MAMOSWINE,[SNORING] 
12,10,184,DAWN,Aww. 
12,10,185,ASH,"Gotta say, Ursula and her Wormadam were pretty good. "
12,10,186,DAWN,Yeah. Those two were totally in sync when it came to using a move. Really impressive. Ursula really showed off all of Wormadam's unique talents. 
12,10,187,URSULA,"Hmph! Surprised, are we? Time after time we've been cut out after only the first round, but not at this Contest! From all that applause and cheering voices, it looks like our efforts have finally paid off. "
12,10,188,DAWN,Well that goes the same for us! 
12,10,189,URSULA,Wouldn't it be sweet if we faced off in the finals? 
12,10,190,MARIAN,Sorry to have kept you waiting so long! And now it's time for the moment you've all been waiting for! 
12,10,191,MARIAN,After careful consideration our judges have chosen the eight Coordinators who will compete in Round Two. And here they are! 
12,10,192,MARIAN,So let's give these eight Coordinators a big round of applause! 
12,10,193,DAWN,"We did it! Thanks to you, Buneary! "
12,10,194,ASH,"Yeah! Way to go, Dawn! "
12,10,195,"AMBIPOM, PIKACHU",[CHEERING] 
12,10,196,DAWN,"Pachirisu, are you ready? "
12,10,197,PACHIRISU,[EXCITED] 
12,10,198,PIPLUP,[ENCOURAGING] 
12,10,199,JESSILINA,Round One's history. Now it's all me. 
12,10,200,URSULA,So! My time has finally come! No way Dawn's gonna change that! 
12,10,201,JAMES,What fun! Our girl's over the hump! 
12,10,202,MEOWTH,Yeah! With a shove from us! 
12,10,203,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
12,10,204,MARIAN,"And now our eight semi-finalists will face off two-by-two in Contest battles as they vie for the coveted Chocovine Ribbon. So with five minutes on the clock, let's go!

Be the best you can be And find your destiny It's the master plan The power's in your hand Pokémon! "
12,10,205,MARIAN,Time's up! And the Coordinator advancing to the final round is... It's Ursula! 
12,10,206,JESSILINA,This isn't the way it's supposed to happen! No fair! 
12,10,207,MEOWTH,She's right. Except it's no fair to us. 
12,10,208,JAMES,Poor Carnivine! You battled with bravery and brawn! But we must carry on! 
12,10,209,WOBBUFFET,[SOBBING AFFIRMATIVE] 
12,10,210,MARIAN,"And now, the Chocovine Contest moves into its final round! We present our two Coordinators. To my left, it's Dawn! And to my right, Ursula! "
12,10,211,ASH,"Dawn, you can do it! Mamoswine, guess you like Dawn after all. "
12,10,212,MAMOSWINE,[SNORING] 
12,10,213,MARIAN,The time will be five minutes! Begin! 
12,10,214,DAWN,"All right Pachirisu, spotlight! "
12,10,215,PACHIRISU,[APPEARING] 
12,10,216,URSULA,"Now, Gabite! Go! Ha ha. "
12,10,217,MARIAN,It's Pachirisu versus Gabite! One Pokémon's cute. And one Pokémon's fierce! But which one will be the winner? 
12,10,218,BROCK,Looks like it's going to be a tough Battle. Pachirisu's Electric-type moves against a Ground type like Gabite won't really be able to do much of anything! 
12,10,219,ASH,Guess you're right Brock! The only thing that might get in there is Super Fang! 
12,10,220,PIPLUP,[WORRIED] 
12,10,221,URSULA,"Gabite, use Dragon Claw! "
12,10,222,GABITE,[DRAGON CLAW MOVE]

12,10,228,URSULA,Ha! There's no escaping Gabite's incredible speed! 
12,10,229,"GABITE, PACHIRISU",[STRIKING] 
12,10,230,DAWN,"Super Fang, let's go! "
12,10,231,PACHIRISU,[SUPER FANG MOVE] 
12,10,232,URSULA,Use Aerial Ace! 
12,10,233,GABITE,[AERIAL ACE MOVE] 
12,10,234,GABITE,[ATTACKING] 
12,10,235,PACHIRISU,[GRUNT] 
12,10,236,BROCK,There's got to be a way for Dawn to turn this around! 
12,10,237,ASH,Dawn! Pachirisu! C'mon guys! 
12,10,238,"GABITE, PACHIRISU",[ATTACKING] 
12,10,239,MARIAN,"Gabite's using its streamlined body to its advantage, landing hit after hit! "
12,10,240,URSULA,No way Pachirisu's gonna be able to show any appeal in this last round. Looks like the appeal is Gabite's and Gabite's alone. 
12,10,241,DAWN,"Sweet Kiss, now! "
12,10,242,PACHIRISU,[SWEET KISS MOVE] 
12,10,243,URSULA,Use Aerial Ace!

12,10,247,"BUNEARY, PIPLUP, PIKACHU",[CHEERING] 
12,10,248,BROCK,The judges evaluate Pachirisu on grace as well. Dawn's just gonna have to count on that. 
12,10,249,ASH,"Maybe, but they're not gonna get many points if they can't do any damage! "
12,10,250,MARIAN,Less than two minutes remaining! 
12,10,251,URSULA,I don't even need half that! 'Cause this battle's almost over! Use tone Edge! 
12,10,252,GABITE,[STONE EDGE MOVE] 
12,10,253,DAWN,Discharge! 
12,10,254,PACHIRISU,[DISCHARGE MOVE] 
12,10,255,PACHIRISU,[PLEASED] 
12,10,256,DAWN,Awesome! You're really warming up now! 
12,10,257,ASH,It's about time Dawn started running the show out there. 
12,10,258,URSULA,"She should realize the Aqua Ribbon isn't a toy. Gabite, Dragon Rage! "

12,03,64,BROCK,"Excuse me, but I think you're bothgoing around in circles. "
12,03,65,DAWN,I have an idea! Why don't you pit your Pokémonagainst each other in battle? 
12,03,66,ASH,"Good idea! Then once you've figuredout which Pokémon's best, Byron can battle with me! "
12,03,67,BYRON,"You up for it, son? "
12,03,68,ROARK,You bet!Thought you'd never ask!

12,03,71,ASH,"Wow, Roark, I had noidea that Byron was your dad! "
12,03,72,ROARK,He sure is! Obviously we get a bit carriedaway with fossils and the like. The real reason I came allthe way here was to ask him to make it back hometo Oreburgh City for his and mymom's anniversary! 
12,03,73,BROCK,"So your father'sfrom Oreburgh City, then? That's great! "
12,03,74,ROARK,He is! Originally mydad worked at the Oreburgh Gym as the Leader there.

12,03,78,BYRON,"Oh! The Pokémon Leagueasked me to head up the Gym in Canalave City,and of course I said yes! "

12,03,80,ROARK,You can't!What about the Oreburgh Gym? 
12,03,81,BYRON,I'm leaving thisGym up to you! See you around! 
12,03,82,ROARK,"Dad, wait! "
12,03,83,ROARK,He didn't even considerwhat my mom and I would think about him leaving. The only personhe ever consulted when he was makingimportant decisions was himself! He always took thetwo of us for granted! 
12,03,84,BROCK,I hear you! He soundslike another dad... namely mine! 
12,03,85,ROARK,He would say hiswhole reason in coming here to Canalave City wasto find lots of fossils! There are a lot offossils on Iron Island nearby. 
12,03,86,DAWN,"Is that what that ""special training onIron Island"" was all about? Digging up fossils? "
12,03,87,PIKACHU,[CONFUSED] 
12,03,88,ROARK,"I'm so sorry for havingto make you wait like this, Ash, really! I just don'twant my dad out-fossiling me! "

11,52,27,PUPIL,Don't worry about it. He'll be back in a few days and I'll be sure to let him know that you're looking to have a battle with him...

11,52,32,DAWN,"It's times like this when the best thing to do is take your mind off of things, so how about some shopping? "
11,52,33,BROCK,"Hey, that's weird... "
11,52,34,DAWN,"What's weird, Brock? "
11,52,35,BROCK,The guidebook says this is the island's busiest shopping district but look around! 
11,52,36,DAWN,"Wow, it's deserted! "
11,52,37,BROCK,"Look, a police station! "
11,52,38,BROCK,Officer Jenny will know the perfect place to shop! And I can't wait to go ask her where! 
11,52,39,BROCK,Jenny? Jenny? 
11,52,40,BROCK,"Jenny, oh, Jenny... ? "
11,52,41,BROCK,"Hi there, Jenny! "
11,52,42,BROCK,Got you! I trust you're all right now? 
11,52,43,JENNY,Has there been an incident? 
11,52,44,BROCK,"No, not exactly! "
11,52,45,JENNY,"That's good! Then good night, sweet dreams... "
11,52,46,BROCK,"But... Jenny, you've got to tell us what's going on around here! "
11,52,47,JENNY,"The thing is, for some reason over the past couple of days every single person on this island has been having nightmares! "
11,52,48,"ASH, DAWN, BROCK",What? 
11,52,49,DAWN,So you must be having them too! 
11,52,50,JENNY,"Right. Everyone's gone to other islands, and that's why this one is so deserted! "
11,52,51,ASH,You have any idea why this's happening? 
11,52,52,JENNY,"Yes! The truth is, we have a Darkrai in our midst! "
11,52,53,"ASH, DAWN, BROCK",What? Darkrai? 
11,52,54,JENNY,Yes! 
11,52,55,JENNY,"Every year at this time a Darkrai pays a visit to our island, bringing nightmares along with it for everybody! -"
11,52,56,DAWN,Every year? -
11,52,57,JENNY,"Right! However, a Cresselia that lives nearby on Fullmoon Island shows up at the same time, warding off Darkrai's nightmarish dreams with its mystical powers! "
11,52,58,JENNY,"But for some reason Darkrai decided to show up early this year, and so far since there's been no sign of the Cresselia everybody's been having nothing but nightmares! And of course it's obvious that nobody's been able to get any sleep! "
11,52,59,JENNY,In desperation I got a Lunar Wing to protect myself from bad dreams! But I'm afraid it hasn't been working all that well... 
11,52,60,BROCK,I've heard of those! They're actually Cresselia feathers! 
11,52,61,JENNY,"As you can see they're very pretty, but the nightmares just go on and on! "
11,52,62,DAWN,See? I've got a Lunar Wing Pendant that I've been wearing for a while... 
11,52,63,ASH,"But, what I want to know is why isn't Jenny's Lunar Wing working? "
11,52,64,BROCK,Do you mind if I have a quick look at that? 
11,52,65,JENNY,"No, not at all! "
11,52,66,BROCK,Thank you! Let's see... 
11,52,67,BROCK,"Jenny, this looks like nothing more than a Pidgey feather that's been painted with lacquer! This thing is a forgery, a fake Lunar Wing! "
11,52,68,JENNY,No way! I paid good money for that! Nobody tricks me... Nobody! 
11,52,69,JENNY,It's arresting time! 
11,52,70,"ASH, DAWN, BROCK, PIPLUP, PIKACHU",[SHOCKED] -
11,52,71,ASH,"Let's follow her, okay? -"

11,52,75,JESSIE,Hold on! Don't worry we'll make more! They'll be up in a jif! 
11,52,76,CUSTOMER A,What? Make more? 
11,52,77,JESSIE,Hush my mouth! Of course the thing I meant to say is we'll find some more! 
11,52,78,MEOWTH,Now it's time to close up shop! 
11,52,79,JESSIE,Whoa. That was a close call! We're lucky! 
11,52,80,MEOWTH,We wouldn't need luck if you'd shut your yap! 
11,52,81,WOBBUFFET,[AGREEING] 
11,52,82,JENNY,Over there! 
11,52,83,ASH,"Something is not right, that's for sure! "
11,52,84,JESSIE,Our Nightmare Maker has exceeded my nightmarish expectations! A pleasant but sleepy surprise... 
11,52,85,JAMES,While everyone puts the blame squarely on Darkrai's shoulders the masses are going loony for our phony Lunar Wings! 
11,52,86,JESSIE,The only problem being our Nightmare Maker works so well we've been having nightmares too! 
11,52,87,MEOWTH,"All the better for pulling tons of all-nighters, and making Lunar Wings! "
11,52,88,MEOWTH,You take a Pidgey feather and bend it... 
11,52,89,MEOWTH,... lacquer it up to make it nice and shiny... 
11,52,90,MEOWTH,... and you end up with a beautiful green money-making machine! 
11,52,91,JENNY,So that's how you did it! 
11,52,92,JENNY,I heard every word! 
11,52,93,"MEOWTH, JESSIE, JAMES",Snoop! 
11,52,94,JENNY,I'm placing you under arrest! 
11,52,95,JESSIE,Is that arrested development I hear? 
11,52,96,JAMES,Her inner rage rings loud and clear! -
11,52,97,JESSIE,On the wind! -
11,52,98,JAMES,Past the stars! 
11,52,99,MEOWTH,In your ear! 
11,52,100,JESSIE,Laying down the law at a breakneck pace! 
11,52,101,JAMES,"Dashing due process, putting fear in its place! "
11,52,102,JESSIE,A Jenny by any other name is just as bad! 
11,52,103,JAMES,"In the name of our law, it looks like you've been had! -"
11,52,104,JESSIE,Jessie! -
11,52,105,JAMES,And James! 
11,52,106,MEOWTH,"Sleepy Meowth, that's a name! "
11,52,107,JESSIE,Putting law abiders in their place!

11,52,115,DAWN,Why don't they ever learn? 
11,52,116,JESSIE,Why do you Twerps manage to show up and turn our dreams of fame and fortune into real nightmares? 
11,52,117,JAMES,We've pulled more all-nighters in order to build this baby than you've been alive! 
11,52,118,MEOWTH,"Then when were done, the worst nightmare turns out to be you! "
11,52,119,ASH,"Why don't you save your whining for jail! Pikachu, use Thunderbolt! "
11,52,120,PIKACHU,[THUNDERBOLT MOVE] 
11,52,121,JAMES,Dear... from one horrendous nightmare to another... 
11,52,122,JESSIE,If we can't sleep the least they could do is give us more airtime... 
11,52,123,"MEOWTH, JESSIE, JAMES",We're blasting off too soon! 
11,52,124,ASH,"Wow, to think all those nightmares were Team Rocket's doing all along... "
11,52,125,DAWN,I guess that also means no Cresselia! 
11,52,126,JENNY,At least people will finally be able to get some sleep again! Can't wait to finally have some good dreams... 
11,52,127,BROCK,Why wait? 
11,52,128,BROCK,Look... the dream you dream at night can also come true during the day if you'll only agree to take my hand...

11,46,96,JESSIE,Well! This could be the moist markof the very monster we seek! A nearby monster!

11,46,104,DAWN,A Lickilicky? 
11,46,105,POKEDEX,Lickilicky.The Licking Pokémon. Lickilicky can wrap itsenormous tongue around anything. Getting too closeto this Pokémon will result in a saliva shower.

11,46,111,ASH,I think it's timeto tell us what's going on! 
11,46,112,ANGIE,"ou see, what happened was, my parents decided to letme look after this Lickitung for a little while, just whilethey were away on vacation! "
11,46,113,ANGIE,But I guessI over-trained it. I even taught it Rollout! 
11,46,114,ANGIE,"The next thing I knew,it evolved into a Lickilicky! "
11,46,115,BROCK,It's never a good thingwhen a caretaker goes ahead and evolves someoneelse's Pokémon... 
11,46,116,ANGIE,"nd to make matters worse, it also happens to hatebeing stuck in its Poké Ball! "
11,46,117,ANGIE,So I've been tryingto keep Lickilicky in this cave just to make sure my Mom and Daddon't find out what happened. 
11,46,118,ANGIE,But there's been the teensy issue ofLickilicky's appetite. It keeps sneakingout of the cave and going off to townsearching around for food! 
11,46,119,ASH,That's a problem. 
11,46,120,DAWN,But why is Lickilicky wearing that thingthat looks like a scarf? 
11,46,121,ANGIE,"That?Well, as you can see Lickilicky's notthe smallest Pokémon and it doesn't like Poké Balls. "
11,46,122,ANGIE,So... 
11,46,123,LICKILICKY,[CONFUSED] 
11,46,124,"ASH, BROCK, DAWN",Wow!

11,44,24,DAWN,Really? Find a counter for Fantina's sleep moves? 
11,44,25,ASH,Yeah! Your Pokémon Contest yesterday gave me some good ideas! 
11,44,26,ASH,The key is to use an att*ck move that causes damage and also blocks your opponent's att*ck! 
11,44,27,DAWN,You mean like Ambipom's Double Hit! 
11,44,28,AMBIPOM,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,44,29,BROCK,"But Ash, haven't you used an att*ck skill for defense sometime in the past? "
11,44,30,ASH,"Yeah, but the thing is, Fantina's sleep moves are a whole different ball game! "
11,44,31,ASH,Ghost-type Pokémon move and att*ck in a really tricky way that's hard to get a get a grip on! 
11,44,32,DAWN,"Yeah, Drifblim and Mismagius are always floating, and you can't really get a feel for what they're going to do! "
11,44,33,ASH,"The only thing to do is att*ck and defend at the same time! I'll tell you, Ambipom, you showed me a lot yesterday! "
11,44,34,AMBIPOM,[PLEASED] 
11,44,35,BROCK,"But I would think a technique like that would only work with Ambipom's skills, since it can be done because Ambipom's got two tails. "

11,44,43,DAWN,Then that means that our little spin has evolved all the way up into an awesomely powerful att*ck! 
11,44,44,PIPLUP,[PLEASED]

11,44,54,RHONDA,"We have just received a report from Officer Jenny, who was actually on the transport at the time of the incident, stating the organization responsible for the theft calls themselves ""Team Galactic."" "
11,44,55,ASH,Team Galactic? 
11,44,56,RHONDA,They are reported to be a secret organization with operations throughout the Sinnoh region. 
11,44,57,RHONDA,"They are also believed to have some connection to the recent Meteorite theft in Veilstone City. However, at this juncture, their objectives continue to remain unclear. "
11,44,58,RHONDA,"At the time of the theft, the legendary Adamant Orb was in the process of being transported from the Eterna City Museum and heading to the Celestic Town Historical Research Center. "
11,44,59,RHONDA,"The research center is currently conducting research on the Adamant Orb's counterpart, the Lustrous Orb, and has tightened its security in light of the recent criminal incident. "
11,44,60,RHONDA,"The Adamant Orb was en route so that both objects could be researched together. Now, however, it is widely expected that this morning's incident will seriously impede the progress of the research. "
11,44,61,JOY,This is quite a serious situation. And the Champion is scheduled to return soon. 
11,44,62,ASH,Are you talking about Cynthia? 
11,44,63,DAWN,Cynthia's coming to Celestic Town? 
11,44,64,JOY,Yes! To the Historical Research Center! 
11,44,65,JOY,"Celestic Town is where she's from, and Cynthia's grandmother is in charge of everything that goes on at the research center! "
11,44,66,ASH,"If she's here, then we should go see her and say hi! "
11,44,67,DAWN,Yeah! 
11,44,68,BROCK,"Nurse Joy, can't you see that you're my Lustrous Orb? I would do anything in my power to protect you! "
11,44,69,BROCK,"All right, what's up? "
11,44,70,ASH,That's weird. 
11,44,71,PIKACHU,[CONCERNED] 
11,44,72,DAWN,What's with Croagunk? 
11,44,73,PIPLUP,[CONCERNED] 
11,44,74,CROAGUNK,[CROAKING] 
11,44,75,JESSIE,Team Galactic's putting it in high gear! 
11,44,76,JAMES,"I'm certain that Lustrous Orb has much to do with all of their ""new world"" jargon. "
11,44,77,MEOWTH,"So, dig! If we were to go and lift that Lustrous Orb, we'd show that flock of fashion freaks a Team Rockety thing or two! "
11,44,78,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,44,79,JESSIE,I'll make them pay for me losing the contest! Those jerks can afford it! 
11,44,80,MEOWTH,"Okay, huddle! It's magic time "
11,44,81,ASH,"Wow, it's gigantic! "
11,44,82,PIKACHU,[IMPRESSED] 
11,44,83,BROCK,That's the Historical Research Center. The Celestic Ruins are directly behind it. 
11,44,84,DAWN,That's where they discovered the Lustrous Orb! 
11,44,85,PIPLUP,[IMPRESSED] 
11,44,86,CYNTHIA,"Hey, it's Ash! "
11,44,87,ASH,"Hi there, Cynthia! "
11,44,88,DAWN,It's been a while! 
11,44,89,BROCK,Wow! Too long to see the Champion! 
11,44,90,CYNTHIA,It's good to see all of you! 
11,44,91,CAROLINA,Who are the children? 
11,44,92,CYNTHIA,I told you about them. Remember? They're the ones who love to challenge everything! 
11,44,93,CAROLINA,Ho ho! The rebellious ways of impetuous youth! 
11,44,94,CYNTHIA,Allow me to introduce Grandmother! 
11,44,95,CYNTHIA,"Her name's Carolina, and she's in charge of the research center! "
11,44,96,ASH,"Wow, it's such a pleasure to meet you! A real honor! "
11,44,97,"DAWN, BROCK",Nice to meet you! 
11,44,98,PIKACHU,[GREETING] 
11,44,99,PIPLUP,[GREETING] 
11,44,100,CAROLINA,Thank you. The pleasure is all mine! I've heard so much about you! 
11,44,101,TEAM GALACTIC GRUNT [M],"Saturn, sir, there's a problem with Phase One of Level E. "
11,44,102,SATURN,"G Two, this is G One relaying confirmation of the source of our problem. It's the group that interfered with the Veilstone Plan. "
11,44,103,MARS,"Ah, how interesting! "
11,44,104,SATURN,"Begin Phase One, but be prepared to switch to backup plan if need be! "
11,44,105,MARS,Roger! 
11,44,106,CAROLINA,"Cynthia was just speaking to me recently about all your rivals, Ash! "
11,44,107,CYNTHIA,What ended up happening with Paul? 
11,44,108,ASH,"We had a battle since. But, well, you know... "
11,44,109,CAROLINA,"I would then venture to guess that means you still can't b*at my granddaughter, either! "
11,44,110,CYNTHIA,"Grandmother, stop that! "
11,44,111,ASH,"The thing is, since we last saw you, we've been training like crazy and made a bunch of new friends! "
11,44,112,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
11,44,113,CAROLINA,"Hey, I like your spunk! Least they can't take that away from you, can they? "
11,44,114,ASH,"So! Why don't you and I have a battle, right now? "
11,44,115,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
11,44,116,CYNTHIA,Now's not so great! 
11,44,117,DAWN,"Grandmother doesn't exactly mince words, does she, Brock? "
11,44,118,"DAWN, BROCK, PIPLUP",[SURPRISED] 
11,44,119,CYRUS,"See, that's just Carolina's way of saying hi! "
11,44,120,CAROLINA,"Land, there are a lot of visitors today! And here's one with a big mouth and blue hair! "
11,44,121,TEAM GALACTIC GRUNT [M],"Sir, Phase One contact! "
11,44,122,TEAM GALACTIC GRUNT [F],System invasion complete. 
11,44,123,MARS,Phase Two ready and standing by. 
11,44,124,SATURN,Copy. 
11,44,125,SATURN,Everyone hold your positions! 
11,44,126,MARS,Roger that! 
11,44,127,CYNTHIA,"Oh my! You must be the world-famous mogul of Sinnoh's industrial complex, Cyrus! "
11,44,128,CYRUS,It's indeed an honor to make the acquaintance of a true Champion! 
11,44,129,CYNTHIA,"You see, Cyrus is responsible for building and library construction throughout Sinnoh! "
11,44,130,"BROCK, DAWN, ASH, PIPLUP, PIKACHU",[IMPRESSED] 
11,44,131,CAROLINA,"Mark my words, Cyrus is quite a big deal around these parts for sure! "
11,44,132,CYRUS,"Now stop that! You're all very kind, but at this point I'd rather be thought of as an amateur history scholar, if you don't mind! "
11,44,133,CAROLINA,Did your concern about the Lustrous Orb bring you? 
11,44,134,CYRUS,"Exactly! When I heard about the Adamant Orb theft, I felt like I had do something! "
11,44,135,BROCK,I know just how you feel! 
11,44,136,BROCK,I must protect the Lustrous Orb and this lovely Champion! 
11,44,137,BROCK,Croagunk? That's twice now. 
11,44,138,ASH,I wonder what's up with Croagunk? 
11,44,139,DAWN,No doubt there's something on its mind. 
11,44,140,CROAGUNK,[CROAKING] 
11,44,141,JESSIE,Backup reporting for duty! 
11,44,142,JAMES,"Requesting assignment, sir! "
11,44,143,MEOWTH,"Yeah, we was just- "
11,44,144,JESSIE,Dope! Zip it! 
11,44,145,JAMES,Since when does a security Pokémon talk? 
11,44,146,MEOWTH,"Oops! OFFICERS [X ], "
11,44,147,GROWLITHE,[SHOCKED] 
11,44,148,CAROLINA,"Since ancient times, our town has had a deep connection with Dialga, as well as Palkia. "
11,44,149,CAROLINA,"And all throughout my extensive research of the town's history, I've acquired mountains of material as a result! "
11,44,150,DAWN,Wow! What an impressive piece! 
11,44,151,DAWN,"Hey, wait! That's it! We've seen that before! "
11,44,152,PIPLUP,[AGREEMENT] 
11,44,153,CAROLINA,You have? 
11,44,154,ASH,"Yeah, and we've seen that one as well! "
11,44,155,PIKACHU,[AGREEMENT] 
11,44,156,CAROLINA,"Frankly, I'm speechless! "
11,44,157,CYNTHIA,Tell me where you saw them! 
11,44,158,DAWN,At Lake Verity! 
11,44,159,PIPLUP,[AGREEMENT] 
11,44,160,DAWN,It was kind of hard to make out but I'm certain that's what it was! 
11,44,161,ASH,We saw something over at Lake Valor! 
11,44,162,PIKACHU,[AGREEMENT] 
11,44,163,"ASH, CYRUS","It was hazy, just like Dawn said, but I'm telling you, I know I saw something on the lake! "
11,44,164,CYNTHIA,I'm at a loss for words! There isn't a single example I can think of where people actually got a glimpse of Lake Guardians! 
11,44,165,ASH,So we saw Lake Guardians? 
11,44,166,CYNTHIA,Yes! 
11,44,167,CYNTHIA,"Dawn, the Lake Guardian you saw was most certainly the Being of Emotion, Mesprit! And Ash, you must've seen the Being of Willpower, Azelf! It's rumored that there is one more Lake Guardian: the Being of Knowledge, Uxie, who lives in Lake Acuity near Snowpoint City! "
11,44,168,BROCK,"Hey, that's the same legend we heard about from Zoey and May! "
11,44,169,CYNTHIA,It's been said for countless generations that all three of those Lake Guardians live in Sinnoh region lakes but they've only existed in legend until now! 
11,44,170,CAROLINA,"One of the legends states that only the spirits of the Lake Guardians emerge from their lakes, so that they're able to watch over and protect humankind. There's a distinct possibility that what you saw were those same spirits! "
11,44,171,"ASH, DAWN",Spirits? 
11,44,172,BROCK,Hold on! Look there! What's the meaning of that thing in the middle? 
11,44,173,CYNTHIA,Our research says it's either the Adamant Orb or the Lustrous Orb! 
11,44,174,CYRUS,Professor? 
11,44,175,CYRUS,"If they've seen Azelf and Mesprit, perhaps you should show them the Lustrous Orb! "
11,44,176,CYRUS,Their reaction may be important to your research! 
11,44,177,CAROLINA,An interesting idea! Come with me! 
11,44,178,"ASH, DAWN, BROCK",Right! 
11,44,179,TEAM GALACTIC GRUNT [F],Placement is now complete! 
11,44,180,MARS,"G Two, roger that. "
11,44,181,JAMES,Attention! Your shift is complete. Dismissed! 
11,44,182,GUARD B,"Understood, sir! "
11,44,183,JESSIE,Through these doors the Lustrous Orb lies. 
11,44,184,JAMES,"Though the question remains, how do we get to that lying orb? "
11,44,185,MEOWTH,"We wait until the coast is clear, then bam! "
11,44,186,OFFICER JENNY,I have bad news. 
11,44,187,OFFICER JENNY,"Due to our heightened security, I'm afraid I can't let you stay very long. "
11,44,188,CAROLINA,"Yes, yes, of course we know! "
11,44,189,"JAMES, JESSIE",The Twerps and then some! 
11,44,190,OFFICER JENNY,Anything unusual to report? 
11,44,191,JAMES,"No, Officer, status quo! "
11,44,192,OFFICER JENNY,"I'll go ahead and open the door then, but you officers please keep a sharp eye out! "
11,44,193,"JAMES, JESSIE",Yes ma'am! 
11,44,194,"PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[AMAZED] 
11,44,195,DAWN,Amazing how it has a strange glow. 
11,44,196,CYRUS,Its beauty is timeless! 
11,44,197,JESSIE,"Wow, Spike Hair's right! "
11,44,198,JAMES,A treasure of the first magnitude! 
11,44,199,MEOWTH,Soon we're going to have a thrilled Boss-itude! 
11,44,200,CYRUS,Tell us what you feel. Anything come to mind? 
11,44,201,ASH,Nope. Don't feel a thing! 
11,44,202,DAWN,Me neither. 
11,44,203,CYRUS,Impossible! You're not looking at it carefully enough! 
11,44,204,CAROLINA,"Now, now, Cyrus, no reason to be upset "
11,44,205,CAROLINA,"Remember, they're only both looking at it for the first time. "
11,44,206,CYRUS,"Uh, right! "
11,44,207,CYRUS,"Sorry. But when I'm standing in front of this treasure, it's so hard to try and be calm! You see, the Lustrous Orb is supposed to be directly connected to the dawn of time. "
11,44,208,ASH,"You study all that, don't you? "
11,44,209,CAROLINA,Cyrus has recently taken up the investigation of many myths that relate to the beginnings of time and our world! 
11,44,210,BROCK,"Cynthia, aren't you doing that as well? "
11,44,211,CYNTHIA,Yes. All to find where our world of people and Pokémon began! 
11,44,212,CYRUS,Yes! 
11,44,213,CYRUS,"You see, the Sinnoh region is said to have originated with Mount Coronet. "
11,44,214,CYRUS,Just try imagining the beginning of the world. A time of no w*r. 
11,44,215,CYRUS,A brand-new paradise of peace! 
11,44,216,CAROLINA,"There you go again, Cyrus! Our Cyrus is a real peacenik, through and through! "
11,44,217,CYRUS,"Of course, the wars I'm talking about are different from Pokémon battles! "
11,44,218,ALL,[SURPRISED] 
11,44,219,CYRUS,"As Pokémon Trainers, you both owe it to yourselves to know the difference between battles and wars! You should never ever forget that! Especially since you have actually met two of the Lake Guardians: Mesprit and Azelf! "
11,44,220,CYRUS,Now give thanks 
11,44,221,CYRUS,for miracles! 
11,44,222,ASH,Miracles? 
11,44,223,DAWN,I don't get why they went and chose us. 
11,44,224,CYRUS,"If you don't mind, I'd like to hear more about what happened at those lakes. "

11,44,233,ASH,Team Galactic! 
11,44,234,PIKACHU,[WORRIED] 
11,44,235,OFFICER JENNY,"Squads Three and Five, blockade the ruins now! Squad Four, make sure you cover area B at once. And Squad Six, you cover area C, and get on it immediately. Now go! "
11,44,236,ALL,[SURPRISED] 
11,44,237,ASH,"Carolina, what happened? "
11,44,238,CAROLINA,Now that's odd. The doors don't seem to want to close. 
11,44,239,OFFICER JENNY,What did you say? 
11,44,240,ANNOUNCER,The research facility's security system has been taken over! We've completely lost control! 
11,44,241,OFFICER JENNY,And that means we won't be able to protect the Lustrous Orb! 
11,44,242,CYNTHIA,"Then we have to move it somewhere else, now! "
11,44,243,ASH,We'll all help protect the orb! 
11,44,244,OFFICER JENNY,"We're lucky that you all are here to help us, just like we were lucky in Veilstone City! So, are you ready to go? "
11,44,245,"ASH, DAWN, BROCK",Yes ma'am!

11,44,262,SATURN,How about handing over that Lustrous Orb now? 
11,44,263,CYNTHIA,I get it! Destroying the ruins was nothing but a diversionary tactic to weaken our defenses! 
11,44,264,SATURN,Perhaps you should concern yourself with what's happening now! 
11,44,265,SATURN,"The truth is, Bronzor's put all of your security forces outside this facility to sleep, and right about now Toxicroak should be taking good care of everyone on the inside. "

11,43,167,DAWN,What a great story!

11,42,291,BROCK,It happens from timeto time with Electric types. Electricity builds upand causes a high fever!

11,42,306,DAWN,"I'm so sorry, Pachirisu. I'm an awful Trainer. "
11,42,307,ASH,"Dawn, don't cry. "
11,42,308,DAWN,Right. 
11,42,309,DAWN,We were trying toget something into Pachirisu by feeding it some mashed fruit. 
11,42,310,BROCK,hat comes a little later! You feed it an Oran Berry first. 
11,42,311,ASH,"We looked for Oran Berries,but no luck! "
11,42,312,BROCK,You won't find them here! It's not the right environmentfor Oran Berries to grow! 
11,42,313,ASH,"Brock, why is that? "

11,41,90,JESSIE,I am! And that's none other than the beautifully busy traveling reporter Jessedia! 
11,41,91,JESSIE,My big scoop for today is all about Fantina and her mountain of magnificent Pokémon! 
11,41,92,JESSIE,"So now, if you'll just work with me by looking into the camera and making media magic! "
11,41,93,JAMES,"First we'll film her while strutting her stuff, then show it to Yanmega! "

11,41,99,PIKACHU,[CONFUSED] 
11,41,100,DAWN,"That sounds strange to me, too. Now what would you need to be training for? "
11,41,101,PIPLUP,[CONFUSED] 
11,41,102,ZOEY,"Well, maybe if you told everyone the same story that you told me a while ago, it would help! I really doubt that they're going to get it if you don't. "
11,41,103,FANTINA,I guess you're right! 
11,41,104,FANTINA,"One day, I had a sort of revelation! I wanted to become much stronger. Stronger for every challenger who came to the Hearthome Gym with the desire to battle me! Now how could I resist that? "
11,41,105,FANTINA,"As a Pokémon Trainer, I had to put in long hours studying. "
11,41,106,FANTINA,"And with a bit of luck, I was able to become Top Coordinator! "
11,41,107,FANTINA,Everyone was generous with their praises for my battling technique. 
11,41,108,FANTINA,and the Hearthome Gym was able to open with moi as its Leader! 
11,41,109,FANTINA,The Hearthome Gym specializes in Ghost-type Pokémon. 
11,41,110,FANTINA,"I faced off against anyone and everyone who came to challenge me! I fought many, many battles. "
11,41,111,FANTINA,"Some of my challengers, even after they failed, would keep training with fierce determination, and then return for a rematch. "
11,41,112,FANTINA,"Seeing them all again, I still felt I had to win, no matter what! "
11,41,113,BROCK,Of course! The truly dedicated Trainers who wouldn't accept defeat the first time around were always nearest and dearest to my heart. 
11,41,114,FANTINA,Alors! You understand my feelings! 
11,41,115,BROCK,Oui. 
11,41,116,ASH,"You see, Brock used to be Gym Leader over at Pewter Gym in Kanto! "
11,41,117,FANTINA,"Wow! Then there's no doubt you understand exactly what I mean! Even Gym Leaders are always in training! They want to get stronger, too! "
11,41,118,BROCK,You're so right! 
11,41,119,FANTINA,"So I gave it a lot of thought, and after a while, it dawned upon me that was the best part of Hearthome Gym battles by far! "
11,41,120,ZOEY,"And that's it! Fantina's been working hard as she can as a Trainer, like us! "
11,41,121,ZOEY,"Doing all the same things we do, like catching Pokémon and battling and gaining all that experience! "
11,41,122,FANTINA,Bien sur! Which finally led me to realize one more thing. 
11,41,123,FANTINA,I had to create a new style of battling! One that would combine the beauty of competition with the ferocity of the b*ttlefield! 
11,41,124,ASH,A new battle style. 
11,41,125,DAWN,So have you been able to come up with your new battling style yet? 
11,41,126,FANTINA,"No, not quite yet, ma chérie. But one step at a time slow and steady! "
11,41,127,BROCK,"Amazing. To become a Gym Leader is not the Trainer's goal. But your desire to level up even now you know, people would do well to start following your example! "
11,41,128,ASH,"I've got to tell you, after hearing your awesome story, I've just got to challenge you to a battle, you know? "
11,41,129,PIKACHU,[EAGER] 
11,41,130,DAWN,Me too! You've inspired me as well to give it my best sh*t! 
11,41,131,PIPLUP,[EAGER] 
11,41,132,JESSIE,"Well, well, there's nothing more interesting than listening to the dreams of a few inspired Twerps. What I'm really trying to say here is: how about a battle? "
11,41,133,JAMES,"I must say, isn't Jessie's decent discourse a bit much? "
11,41,134,MEOWTH,Don't let it fool you! Jess is sucking up because she wants to film her rocking the house! 
11,41,135,WOBBUFFET,[IMPRESSED] 
11,41,136,FANTINA,"When traveling Trainers meet on the road, their first words are, ""Let's battle!"" And since you and I fit that description to a tee, I accept your challenge! "
11,41,137,ASH,"Well, all right! "
11,41,138,PIKACHU,[THRILLED] 
11,41,139,FANTINA,"But since my Pokémon are feeling très fatigué, I'm afraid I'll only be able to battle with one of you! "
11,41,140,"ASH, DAWN",Right! 
11,41,141,ASH,So let's figure this out! 
11,41,142,DAWN,I happen to have just the thing to decide which one of us battles her. 
11,41,143,ASH,Great idea! It's Coin Toss time! 
11,41,144,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
11,41,145,"DAWN, PIPLUP",[DISAPPOINTED] 
11,41,146,DAWN,"Okay, why? Why did I have to be so dumb that I'd go and pick heads? "
11,41,147,ZOEY,"Come on, it's just a game! Win a few and you lose a few. "
11,41,148,BROCK,"After all those things Fantina said, it's obvious Ghost-type Pokémon are the Hearthome Gym's specialty! "
11,41,149,ZOEY,Yeah! And she's an expert at using those tricky skills of hers! 
11,41,150,DAWN,"No need to worry, right? "
11,41,151,PIPLUP,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,41,152,FANTINA,"All right, please be so kind as to share with us your rules! "
11,41,153,ASH,I'd like a three-on-three! And the battle's over if all three of one side's Pokémon can't continue! 
11,41,154,FANTINA,Excellente! And we both may substitute Pokémon! 
11,41,155,ASH,Great! 
11,41,156,PIKACHU,[ENTHUSIASTIC] 
11,41,157,BROCK,"She's allowing Pokémon substitutions! You know, it's just like a Trainer's battle! "
11,41,158,DAWN,You're right! I guess those sorts of things aren't usually allowed when you're actually challenging a Gym Leader! 
11,41,159,ASH,"Dawn, how about doing another Coin Toss? We've got to decide who goes first! "
11,41,160,DAWN,You've got it! 
11,41,161,PIPLUP,[SURPRISED] 
11,41,162,DAWN,"Okay then, you two, call it quickly! "
11,41,163,ASH,"All right, then I call tails! "
11,41,164,FANTINA,Then of course I call heads! 
11,41,165,DAWN,I've got it! Ready? Coin Toss! 
11,41,166,DAWN,It's heads! 
11,41,167,FANTINA,Ooh la la! And that means I go first! 
11,41,168,ASH,Right! 
11,41,169,JESSIE,Production note! Focus on the Leader and don't give that tottering Twerp any airtime! 
11,41,170,JAMES,Duly noted! 
11,41,171,ASH,"Whoa, she's holding a Poké Ball! That's got to mean Mismagius isn't going to go first. "
11,41,172,PIKACHU,[WARY] 
11,41,173,ASH,"After spending all those hours practicing with Dawn, I know how Contest Battles go. "
11,41,174,ASH,But I'm just not sure how to start! It's all or nothing. Let's do it! 
11,41,175,ASH,"Okay, Buizel, I choose you! "
11,41,176,BUIZEL,[APPEARING] 
11,41,177,FANTINA,"Alors Drifloon! Battle position, vite! "
11,41,178,DRIFLOON,[APPEARING] 
11,41,179,ASH,Drifloon! 
11,41,180,FANTINA,I've raised this darling little one since it was a baby Pokémon! 
11,41,181,ASH,"Buizel! Since you never know what it's going to do, be careful, okay? "
11,41,182,BUIZEL,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,41,183,FANTINA,"Then let's begin! Drifloon, use Ominous Wind! "
11,41,184,DRIFLOON,[OMINOUS WIND MOVE] 
11,41,185,ASH,"Quick, use Water g*n! "
11,41,186,BUIZEL,[WATER g*n MOVE] 
11,41,187,DRIFLOON,[EFFORT] 
11,41,188,"DRIFLOON, BUIZEL",[PROUD] 
11,41,189,DAWN,How did Drifloon dodge that? 
11,41,190,BROCK,"Buizel's counterattack was timed well, but... "
11,41,191,ZOEY,"Brock, just wait. Fantina's just getting warmed up! "
11,41,192,DRIFLOON,[CONFIDENT] 
11,41,193,BUIZEL,[STRUGGLING] 
11,41,194,ASH,"Whoa, Buizel's surrounded by wind! "
11,41,195,"PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[ENCOURAGING] 
11,41,196,BROCK,"Wow, she doesn't miss a trick! "
11,41,197,ZOEY,"She's really living up to her position as Gym Leader, isn't she? Who knew a Drifloon could do something like that? "
11,41,198,DAWN,She's choosing all her moves perfectly. 
11,41,199,DAWN,I'm just hoping Ash and Buizel don't get too caught up in the heat of the battle! 
11,41,200,PIPLUP,[ENCOURAGING] 
11,41,201,JESSIE,Keep that itchy trigger finger nice and itchy! 
11,41,202,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,41,203,ASH,"All right, Buizel, use Aqua Jet! "
11,41,204,BUIZEL,[AQUA JET MOVE] 
11,41,205,DRIFLOON,[PAINED] 
11,41,206,DRIFLOON,[DETERMINED] 
11,41,207,FANTINA,"Buizel, that move of yours was superbe! But get ready for this! "
11,41,208,FANTINA,Use Hypnosis! 
11,41,209,DRIFLOON,[HYPNOSIS MOVE] 
11,41,210,BUIZEL,[NERVOUS] 
11,41,211,ASH,"Buizel, wake up! "
11,41,212,ZOEY,Unbelievable! I never knew Hypnosis could be used like that! 
11,41,213,BROCK,"After taking a good long look at Buizel's moves, Fantina figured out a weakness in Ash's strategy! So after he launched that Aqua Jet. "
11,41,214,BROCK,she threw him a change-up! 
11,41,215,FANTINA,"Alors, dear Drifloon, go and pick Buizel up! "
11,41,216,DRIFLOON,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,41,217,DRIFLOON,[EFFORT] 
11,41,218,DAWN,But Buizel's still fast asleep! 
11,41,219,BROCK,That Hypnosis of Drifloon's packs quite a punch 
11,41,220,ZOEY,"On top of that, Fantina's using Buizel fast asleep to show off Drifloon's power! "
11,41,221,FANTINA,"Drifloon, use Psychic! "
11,41,222,DRIFLOON,[PSYCHIC MOVE] 
11,41,223,ASH,"Come on, Buizel, wake up! "
11,41,224,BUIZEL,[STARTLED] 
11,41,225,BUIZEL,[DETERMINED] 
11,41,226,ASH,"Great! Buizel, you woke up! "
11,41,227,BUIZEL,[PROUD] / [STUNNED] 
11,41,228,ASH,"Buizel, no! "
11,41,229,DAWN,After all that! 
11,41,230,PIPLUP,[UPSET] 
11,41,231,ZOEY,Looks like Buizel took quite a bit of damage from that Ominous Wind. 
11,41,232,ASH,"Buizel, that was some great work! "
11,41,233,ASH,Now you get yourself a good long rest! 
11,41,234,ASH,"Chimchar, let's go! "
11,41,235,CHIMCHAR,[APPEARING] 
11,41,236,JAMES,It's Chimmy's time to shine! 
11,41,237,FANTINA,"It is with my dear Drifloon that I will stay! Alors, Ash, it is you who has the honor! "
11,41,238,ASH,"Okay, Chimchar! No holding back! Flamethrower! "
11,41,239,CHIMCHAR,[FLAMETHROWER MOVE] 
11,41,240,FANTINA,"Plus vite, Drifloon, Psychic! "
11,41,241,DRIFLOON,[PSYCHIC MOVE] 
11,41,242,ASH,What happened? 
11,41,243,FANTINA,"Now, s'il vous plait, we'll take control of that! "
11,41,244,DRIFLOON,[FOCUSED] 
11,41,245,CHIMCHAR,[SHOCKED] 
11,41,246,ASH,Fantina's using Psychic to control our Flamethrower? 
11,41,247,ZOEY,"I've seen Trainers use their opponent's Pokémon's skills a lot in Contest Battles before, but never like she does! "
11,41,248,JESSIE,Yowslers! 
11,41,249,JAMES,Drifloon sure knows how to fly high. 
11,41,250,FANTINA,"Now prepare for a surprise, Will-O-Wisp! "
11,41,251,DRIFLOON,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,41,252,CHIMCHAR,[WORRIED] 
11,41,253,DAWN,Look out! 
11,41,254,DRIFLOON,[WILL-O-WISP MOVE] 
11,41,255,CHIMCHAR,[PAINED] 
11,41,256,FANTINA,"Now, Hypnosis! "
11,41,257,DRIFLOON,[HYPNOSIS MOVE] 
11,41,258,CHIMCHAR,[PAINED] 
11,41,259,CHIMCHAR,[STRUGGLING] 
11,41,260,ASH,"No, not again! "
11,41,261,DAWN,I can't believe it! 
11,41,262,MEOWTH,"Chimmy's napping, too! "
11,41,263,ASH,"Chimchar, return! "
11,41,264,DAWN,Good! Ash managed to get Chimchar back into its Poké Ball before it was too late! 
11,41,265,BROCK,That's not as good as it looks. 
11,41,266,BROCK,"See, unlike confusion, sleep continues even when a Pokémon returns to its Poké Ball! "
11,41,267,ASH,"Pikachu, it's you! "
11,41,268,PIKACHU,[DETERMINED] 
11,41,269,ASH,"If Pikachu falls asleep, that's it! What do we do? "
11,41,270,PIKACHU,[ENCOURAGING] 
11,41,271,ASH,"Right, Pikachu! I hear you! You get lemons, you make lemonade! And that's what we do best, right? "
11,41,272,PIKACHU,[DETERMINED] 
11,41,273,FANTINA,"Alors, this time I start! Drifloon, Will-O-Wisp! "
11,41,274,DRIFLOON,[WILL-O-WISP MOVE] 
11,41,275,PIKACHU,[PAINED] 
11,41,276,ASH,Pikachu! Thunderbolt! 
11,41,277,PIKACHU,[THUNDERBOLT MOVE] 
11,41,278,DRIFLOON,[PAINED] 
11,41,279,FANTINA,"Well, I'm impressed! That Thunderbolt is magnifique! "
11,41,280,DRIFLOON,[CHALLENGING] 
11,41,281,ASH,"Yeah? Well, let's just see how you like this! Volt Tackle! "
11,41,282,PIKACHU,[VOLT TACKLE MOVE] 
11,41,283,FANTINA,Ominous Wind! 
11,41,284,DRIFLOON,[OMINOUS WIND MOVE] 
11,41,285,PIKACHU,[STRUGGLING] 
11,41,286,ASH,What? 
11,41,287,BROCK,"That Ominous Wind is so powerful, it's stopping the Volt Tackle! "
11,41,288,JESSIE,I want to do that! Whatever that is! 
11,41,289,PIKACHU,[DETERMINED] 
11,41,290,ASH,"Yeah! Pikachu, hang on! "
11,41,291,FANTINA,Oh! I've never seen such burning spirit! This battle is now in your hands! 
11,41,292,PIKACHU,[STRUGGLING] 
11,41,293,PIKACHU,[SHOCKED] 
11,41,294,ASH,"Are you okay, Pikachu? "
11,41,295,PIKACHU,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,41,296,ASH,"All right, Thunderbolt, let's go! "
11,41,297,PIKACHU,[THUNDERBOLT MOVE] 
11,41,298,DRIFLOON,[PAINED] 
11,41,299,ASH,That's it! 
11,41,300,FANTINA,Oh! Your Pikachu seems so much stronger! 
11,41,301,DAWN,Look at Pikachu go! 
11,41,302,BROCK,Yeah! Ash can sure turn the tables! 
11,41,303,DRIFLOON,[STRUGGLING] 
11,41,304,FANTINA,Alors! My Drifloon's starting to evolve! 
11,41,305,ASH,Evolving now? 
11,41,306,PIKACHU,[SHOCKED] 
11,41,307,"BROCK, ZOEY, DAWN, HAPPINY, GLAMEOW, PIPLUP",[SHOCKED] 
11,41,308,DRIFBLIM,[GREETING] 
11,41,309,FANTINA,Incroyable! My Drifloon has evolved into a Drifblim! Vraiment incroyable! 
11,41,310,DAWN,So that's a Drifblim. 
11,41,311,POKEDEX,"Drifblim. The Blimp Pokémon, and the evolved form of Drifloon. Because it travels on wind currents, Drifblim's movements are unusual and unpredictable. "
11,41,312,FANTINA,"I'm witnessing a miracle! Better brace yourself, Ash! "
11,41,313,ASH,"No prob! You don't have to worry about Pikachu and me! Pikachu, Thunderbolt, let's go! "
11,41,314,PIKACHU,[THUNDERBOLT MOVE] 
11,41,315,FANTINA,Keep your eyes peeled! Calmly floating just like that! 
11,41,316,DRIFBLIM,[FOCUSED] 
11,41,317,ASH,What? 
11,41,318,PIKACHU,[SHOCKED] 
11,41,319,DAWN,Drifblim dodged! 
11,41,320,ZOEY,Pikachu's Thunderbolt is too strong to take! 
11,41,321,BROCK,But a Blimp Pokémon like Drifblim can dodge moves like that so easily that it almost seems like it's controlling them! 
11,41,322,JESSIE,You get that? 
11,41,323,JAMES,Every marvy move! 
11,41,324,MEOWTH,That lady's got that Top Coordinator and Gym Leader groove! 
11,41,325,FANTINA,"Now, Hypnosis! "
11,41,326,DRIFBLIM,[CONFIDENT] 
11,41,327,PIKACHU,[SCARED] 
11,41,328,DRIFBLIM,[HYPNOSIS MOVE] 
11,41,329,PIKACHU,[PAINED] 
11,41,330,ASH,Pikachu! 
11,41,331,PIKACHU,[STRUGGLING] 
11,41,332,ASH,"Pikachu, you've got to wake up! "
11,41,333,ASH,That's it. 
11,41,334,FANTINA,Oui. Looks like it. 
11,41,335,ASH,Guess so. There's not much I can do if Chimchar and Pikachu are both sleeping. It's over. 
11,41,336,DAWN,"Oh, Ash. "
11,41,337,PIPLUP,[SAD] 
11,41,338,BROCK,"But you have to admit, this battle was totally different from anything you've ever experienced! "
11,41,339,ASH,"You're right! I just couldn't get myself into a solid groove at all. The more I worried about my Pokémon sleeping, the less concentration I wound up having. "
11,41,340,FANTINA,"The thing is, even the best of us come up short sometimes. "
11,41,341,ASH,"Well, I want to give the Hearthome Gym another sh*t! "
11,41,342,FANTINA,I accept your challenge! And thank you for a battle incroyable! 
11,41,343,ASH,So we'll get to battle again? 
11,41,344,FANTINA,"First, I am going to head back to the Hearthome Gym and do some homework with my Drifblim! In the meantime, you have a magnifique time out on the road! "
11,41,345,DAWN,"Fantina? If it's possible we'd love to have a battle with you, too! "
11,41,346,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
11,41,347,FANTINA,"Mais oui, ma chérie Dawn, I promise, bien sur! "
11,41,348,DAWN,Great! 
11,41,349,FANTINA,"Meanwhile, let's all keep working, since you can't count your Torchic before they hatch, n'est-ce pas? "
11,41,350,"ASH, DAWN",You bet! 
11,41,351,BROCK,"Zoey, any idea what she just said? "
11,41,352,JESSIE,Now look at that right there! 
11,41,353,JESSIE,"Yanmega, from now on, dodge just like that! "
11,41,354,YANMEGA,[INTIMIDATED] 
11,41,355,JESSIE,No can do? Don't take that tone with me! 
11,41,356,YANMEGA,[DEJECTED] 
11,41,357,JAMES,But a Yanmega is a Pokémon of a different stripe! 
11,41,358,MEOWTH,It couldn't act like a Drifblim if you paid it! 
11,41,359,JESSIE,Both of you! Quiet gumming up proverbial works with facts! Time for some special training! 
11,41,360,YANMEGA,[COMPLAINING] 
11,41,361,DAWN,"Wow! Your third ribbon, Zoey! "
11,41,362,ZOEY,Yeah. Shellos really came through for me! 
11,41,363,DAWN,Losing is something I can't afford to do! So you're really not going to be in the Celestic Town Contest? 
11,41,364,ZOEY,"I'm going to take a pass this time. But I'll be there cheering for you, don't worry! "
11,41,365,DAWN,"That's great, Zoey! Hey, Ash, guess what? Zoey's going to- "
11,41,366,"PIPLUP, ZOEY, GLAMEOW",[SURPRISED] 
11,41,367,BROCK,Ash is going over today's battle in his head 
11,41,368,ASH,Man! Feels like my head is going to explode! 
11,41,369,PIKACHU,[CONCERNED] 
11,41,370,ASH,"I do know that every time we got hit by that Hypnosis, we were toast! From now on, we're going to work night and day, figuring out how to punch that Hypnosis right in the nose! [EXCITED] "
11,41,371,DAWN,"And I've got to get focused on winning that Celestic Town Contest Ribbon, you know? So, Ash, it looks like you and I have got some work to do! "
11,41,372,ASH,"Right. Next time we're at the Hearthome Gym, we're going to rock! "
11,41,373,NARRATOR,"A temporary setback perhaps, following a defeat at the hands of the amazingly skillful Gym Leader Fantina. "
11,41,374,NARRATOR,"But what matters is what Ash does with that defeat, as he prepares to take on the Hearthome Gym once and for all! So stay tuned! [THEME MUSIC PLAYING"

11,39,24,ANGIE,"It's good to be pumped up, but keep up the hot air, and you'll pass out! "
11,39,25,ANGIE,"For your information Ash, the Pokémon Summer Academy Triathlon is a lot more intense than you think! "
11,39,26,ASH,Go ahead and say whatever you want! I'm gonna get first place! 
11,39,27,ANGIE,"No, that'll be me! You're better off aiming for second! "
11,39,28,ASH,You've got it backwards! 
11,39,29,ANGIE,I don't think so! 
11,39,30,DAWN,Just stop it! Both of you! 
11,39,31,PIPLUP,[BOTHERED]

11,39,38,ANGIE,"Nothing. I'm fine! Come on, let's go! "
11,39,39,SHINX,[RUNNING] 
11,39,40,ASH,What got into her? 
11,39,41,PIKACHU,[CONFUSED]

11,39,46,CONWAY,And I've come to the conclusion that you're going to be my most formidable rival in the Pokémon Triathlon! 
11,39,47,DAWN,Your rival? 
11,39,48,CONWAY,"That's right, Dawn. I've got you marked, see? Sounds exciting, eh? "

11,39,58,CHANSEY,[COMFORTING] 
11,39,59,BROCK,"Just the thought of a lovely lady in waiting, wow! My blood pressure is rising, and my heart's pounding a mile a minute, which can only mean one thing! "

11,39,70,JAMES,Jessie's team spirit is on full burn! 
11,39,71,MEOWTH,"Maybe, but her empty head can't seem to grasp that the Green Team's winning chances are zip, zero, nada. "
11,39,72,JAMES,True. But it would be good for our future health if Jessie were to take that victory lap. 
11,39,73,MEOWTH,Of course! And we could help out by getting sneaky. 
11,39,74,JAMES,"Oh, I just love a good sneak! "
11,39,75,DAWN,Until the marathon why don't you take a good rest?

11,38,267,RENOVATION WORKERS,Whoa! 
11,38,268,ROWAN,We discovered a cave deep within a stone wall. 
11,38,269,ROWAN,And there are some who think it might be the legendary entrance to the spirit world. 
11,38,270,"DAWN, BROCK",Entrance to the spirit world? 
11,38,271,ROWAN,Right. The Pokédex states that Dusknoir will take people to the spirit world. 
11,38,272,ROWAN,And if in fact that's where the Dusknoir in question comes from 
11,38,273,ROWAN,it's possible that Dusknoir's attempting to take someone back with it. 
11,38,274,"BROCK, DAWN, MITCHELL, PIPLUP",[NERVOUS] 
11,38,275,CONWAY,I have reason to believe there's a possibility it may have already abducted a girl! 
11,38,276,ASH,We finally made it! 
11,38,277,ANGIE,Not a moment too soon. 
11,38,278,PIKACHU,[RELIEVED]

11,38,346,ASH,Even if that means forever! 
11,38,347,ANGIE,Forever? 
11,38,348,ROWAN,Over there! 
11,38,349,YUZO,Is that the spirit world entrance? 
11,38,350,BROCK,I think something's trying to pull them into the spirit world! 
11,38,351,DAWN,We've got to do something! 
11,38,352,ROWAN,"Stop! Don't get any closer, either of you! "
11,38,353,GIRL [DEMON],Let's play. Hurry up.

11,38,358,"PIKACHU, SHINX",[CONFUSED] 
11,38,359,ASH,What are you doing? 
11,38,360,ANGIE,Whoa. Dusknoir you're trying to save us! 
11,38,361,DUSKNOIR,[AGREEING] 
11,38,362,ROWAN,Well! It seems Dusknoir is protecting them! 
11,38,363,DAWN,I don't get it! 
11,38,364,DUSKNOIR,[STRUGGLING] 
11,38,365,ANGIE,We're gonna be sucked in! 
11,38,366,DUSKNOIR,[ATTACKING] 
11,38,367,ASH,Just a little bit longer and we would've ended up trapped in that cave. 
11,38,368,ANGIE,"Dusknoir. You were looking out for us all along, weren't you? "
11,38,369,DUSKNOIR,[AFFIRMING] 
11,38,370,ANGIE,"That's great, thank you! "
11,38,371,ASH,Yeah! You're awesome after all! 
11,38,372,ANGIE,"Dusknoir, come back! "
11,38,373,DUSKNOIR,[CALMLY] 
11,38,374,ANGIE,That's the entrance to the spirit world? 
11,38,375,ROWAN,"We honestly don't know that for certain, but it is obvious Dusknoir had a vested interest in guarding it. "
11,38,376,ROWAN,"The fact is, scientists still have a very long way to go before we truly understand our world. "
11,38,377,CONWAY,Does that mean the girl I was partnered with wasn't in the Academy? 
11,38,378,ASSISTANT C,To tell the truth I seriously doubt that girl was part of this world! 
11,38,379,DAWN,I guess that means you were partnered with a ghost! 
11,38,380,CONWAY,I was partnered with a ghost. 
11,38,381,CONWAY,I was partnered with a ghost? 
11,38,382,ROWAN,"We had quite a busy night, but you all performed admirably. "
11,38,383,ROWAN,So I've decided to give each team thirty points! 
11,38,384,JESSIE,Now what kind of communal drivel is that? 
11,38,385,BROCK,So that means we still stay in second place! 
11,38,386,CONWAY,"Well for the Blue Team, it's definitely lonely at the top. "
11,38,387,ASH,"Listen up! Okay Red Team, let's get on the stick and turn this thing around! "
11,38,388,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
11,38,389,NARRATOR,"And so, as the end of the Pokémon Summer Academy draws near... "
11,38,390,NARRATOR,...the subject of our Heroes' last assignment remains a mystery! Will Ash and friends make a comeback? Stay tuned! [THEME MUSIC PLAYING
11,37,0,NARRATOR,"With the first two exciting days of Pokémon Summer Academy behind them, our Heroes, along with all kinds of new friends, people, and Pokémon alike are determinedly heading into Day Three! "

11,37,2,ROWAN,"Now, what do you say to something a little different? "
11,37,3,ROWAN,"Good! Because, today I'd like you to observe the Water-type Pokémon in this lake. "
11,37,4,YUZO,"Now, as you can see, these waters are teeming with many kinds of Pokémon, and the choice of which kind to focus on is completely up to you! "
11,37,5,YUZO,"You may express your findings in a report, sketch, or any way you choose. "
11,37,6,YUZO,But your grade will be based on a final presentation! 
11,37,7,YUZO,"You may work on your own, or in groups if you prefer. "
11,37,8,ROWAN,But because the Water-type Pokémon in this lake area are still being researched they are not allowed to be caught! 
11,37,9,YUZO,"Also, please remember leaving the area is forbidden. Priority One is safety first! "
11,37,10,ASH,Right! Pikachu! 
11,37,11,ASH,Let's go check out some Water-type Pokémon and get an A plus! 
11,37,12,PIKACHU,[ENTHUSIASTIC] 
11,37,13,ANGIE,"Well, you're not getting ahead of me! "
11,37,14,ANGIE,"All right Shinx, what do you say we move? "
11,37,15,DAWN,"Us too! What do you say we b*at them all, Piplup? "

11,37,18,ROWAN,Right! Off you go! 
11,37,19,ASH,WOW! I'll bet those are a blast! 
11,37,20,DAWN,They'd be a great way to observe Pokémon. 
11,37,21,ANGIE,Sure would! 
11,37,22,ASH,What's that? 
11,37,23,PIKACHU,[ENTRANCED]

11,37,27,ASH,You were acting weird! 
11,37,28,PIKACHU,[UNSURE] 
11,37,29,ASH,That's strange. 
11,37,30,ASH,I wonder what that light was! 
11,37,31,ANGIE,Hey Ash! Want to take a boat with me? 
11,37,32,ASH,"Sure, let's go! "
11,37,33,BROCK,"So Dawn, let's grab the other one. "
11,37,34,DAWN,Right! 
11,37,35,JESSIE,It's important to remember ultra-violet rays can be skin's worst enemy! 
11,37,36,JESSIE,"So please! Smooth and steady as she goes, men. BOYS A&amp;"
11,37,37,B,Aye aye! Ms. Jessilinda!

11,37,40,JAMES,Our Jessie certainly knows how to run a tight ship! 
11,37,41,MEOWTH,"With all those ocean liners named after queens, I'm not surprised! "
11,37,42,JAMES,"True, though I fear our queen may have forgotten we've really come here to swipe the school's Pokémon! "

11,37,86,BOY A,Oh! What kind of Pokémon did you have in mind? 
11,37,87,JESSIE,Elegant! Like the suave Suicune! Or perhaps the cute Manaphy! 
11,37,88,BOY A,There's just one thing! 
11,37,89,BOY B,I don't think there are any Suicune or Manaphy in this lake Ms. Jessilinda. 
11,37,90,JESSIE,Don't you bore me with details!! Capisce?

11,37,133,ASH,I didn't know a Dewgong's horn was so hard! 
11,37,134,DEWGONG,[RELAXED]

11,37,140,GOREBYSS,[FLATTERED] 
11,37,141,ASH,Let's observe them a little more and then get to work! 
11,37,142,BROCK,Right! Then finally comes the report. 
11,37,143,ANGIE,"Oh goody. When to comes to reports, I'm the worst! "
11,37,144,ASH,"No, I am. "
11,37,145,DAWN,"Nope, me! "
11,37,146,CONWAY,Fear not Dawn! For I'd be happy to transcribe your thoughts! 
11,37,147,DAWN,What do you mean transcribe? 
11,37,148,CONWAY,Elementary! It simply means you do the talking 
11,37,149,CONWAY,and then I'll write everything you say down and turn it into the perfect report! See? 
11,37,150,DAWN,"Uh, thank you but I think I have to write the report myself. "
11,37,151,CONWAY,"As you wish. But if you decide to change your mind, I'll be around, okay? Okay. "
11,37,152,SHINX,[ENTRANCED] 
11,37,153,ASH,'Kay! Let's finish this up! 
11,37,154,ANGIE,Hold on.

11,37,156,ANGIE,All of a sudden Shinx is missing!

11,37,168,ASH,There's that light again! 
11,37,169,DAWN,What do you mean again? 
11,37,170,ASH,It flashed before over there! 
11,37,171,PIPLUP,[DAZED]

11,37,175,ASH,The same result! 
11,37,176,DAWN,Result? 
11,37,177,ASH,"Yeah. First that light flashed, and then Pikachu's eyes got all spacey. "
11,37,178,PIKACHU,[ENTRANCED] 
11,37,179,CONWAY,Interesting. 
11,37,180,CONWAY,If that is in fact what happened then the legend may end up being true! 
11,37,181,DAWN,What legend? 
11,37,182,CONWAY,"You see, there's a famous legend concerning this lake. "
11,37,183,CONWAY,"It says that when a strange blue light flashes, Pokémon start vanishing! "
11,37,184,ASH,"Man, I don't like that legend at all. Strange blue light? "
11,37,185,DAWN,And then Pokémon vanish? 
11,37,186,CONWAY,"Well, with Shinx disappearing, it may just have something to do with that legend, get it? "
11,37,187,ASH,We've got to do something! 
11,37,188,ANGIE,You're right! I say we head over to where that light is coming from! 
11,37,189,DAWN,Piplup! 
11,37,190,CONWAY,"Hey folks, remember we're not allowed to go far from the lake! "
11,37,191,CONWAY,But if Dawn's going I guess there's not much I can do. 
11,37,192,JAMES,That flash has lots of zing! 
11,37,193,MEOWTH,You mean like some treasure-type bling? 
11,37,194,JAMES,I was thinking the same thing! 
11,37,195,"ANGIE, DAWN, BROCK, PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[CURIOUS] -
11,37,196,ASH,Which way? -
11,37,197,DAWN,"Well, if I remember... "
11,37,198,CONWAY,It was directly northwest of here. 
11,37,199,DAWN,You don't have to come with us. 
11,37,200,CONWAY,"No no, I want to soak in everything I possibly can about Pokémon! "
11,37,201,JESSIE,Perfect! 
11,37,202,JESSIE,"The left, that's it. Oh, that's great. "
11,37,203,JESSIE,What do you want? 
11,37,204,CONWAY,I'm quite confident Shinx is around here! 
11,37,205,DAWN,There's something creepy about this place. 
11,37,206,CONWAY,Not to worry! No matter what happens rest assured I'll protect you. 
11,37,207,CONWAY,HELLLLP MEEE! 
11,37,208,ASH,Man it's really coming down! 
11,37,209,ANGIE,I sure hope that Shinx's okay. 
11,37,210,PIKACHU,[CONCERNED] 
11,37,211,PIPLUP,[SAD] 
11,37,212,BROCK,I think we should take a break for a while. 
11,37,213,CONWAY,Look at this! 
11,37,214,CONWAY,"That's right! The legend states: ""The strange blue light comes forth from the green cave."" "
11,37,215,ANGIE,Looks green to me! 
11,37,216,DAWN,Then that means the light from the legend is back there? 
11,37,217,ASH,Then we've got to go look! 
11,37,218,PIKACHU,[SEARCHING] 
11,37,219,DAWN,That is the light! 
11,37,220,PIKACHU,[ENTRANCED] 
11,37,221,ASH,C'mon Pikachu! Keep it together! 
11,37,222,PIKACHU,[ALERT] 
11,37,223,BROCK,Then something's got to be back there! 
11,37,224,ANGIE,Shinx should be there too! 
11,37,225,ANGIE,SHIIINX! Where are you? Shinx! 
11,37,226,ASH,Shinx come out! 
11,37,227,DAWN,Let us know where you are! 
11,37,228,PIKACHU,[SEARCHING] 
11,37,229,PIPLUP,[CALLING] 
11,37,230,ASH,Don't look! 
11,37,231,"PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[HIDING] 
11,37,232,PIPLUP,[ENTRANCED] 
11,37,233,DAWN,"No Piplup, snap out of it! "
11,37,234,PIPLUP,[ALERT] 
11,37,235,ANGIE,So that's it! 
11,37,236,ASH,This is where the strange blue light's coming from! 
11,37,237,LUMINEON,[APPEARING] -
11,37,238,ASH,What's that? -
11,37,239,BROCK,A Lumineon! 
11,37,240,DAWN,Lumineon? 
11,37,241,CONWAY,"Lumineon, the Neon Pokémon. Lumineon lives in the ocean's depths. "
11,37,242,CONWAY,It lures Pokémon by flashing light in the pattern of its tail fins. 
11,37,243,BROCK,So it was Lumineon's light we were seeing! 
11,37,244,DAWN,Lumineon's beautiful! 
11,37,245,CONWAY,It's strange. 
11,37,246,CONWAY,A Lumineon shouldn't be in a place like this! 
11,37,247,BROCK,"Yeah, you're right. "
11,37,248,SHINX,[ENTRANCED] 
11,37,249,ALL,[CURIOUS] 
11,37,250,SHINX,[ENTRANCED] 
11,37,251,ANGIE,Shinx! 
11,37,252,ANGIE,"Pull yourself together, Shinx! "
11,37,253,SHINX,[ALERT] 
11,37,254,ANGIE,I can't tell you how worried I was! 
11,37,255,SHINX,[DISORIENTED] 
11,37,256,ASH,"Now that we've found Shinx, we can breathe again! "
11,37,257,DAWN,"Yeah, and we know where the light's coming from too! "
11,37,258,BROCK,"You're right, but... "
11,37,259,BROCK,"We have no idea why Lumineon's here! If we could get to the bottom of that, think of the great report we could do! -"
11,37,260,ASH,You're right! -
11,37,261,ANGIE,What a great idea! 
11,37,262,DAWN,Let's do it! 
11,37,263,CONWAY,I'd like to be a part of this as well. 
11,37,264,JESSIE,Hold on a minute! 
11,37,265,JESSIE,It appears I've finally found a Pokémon that matches me! 
11,37,266,CONWAY,"I know you! You're Jessilinda, the leader of the Green Team! "
11,37,267,JESSIE,"That's MISS Jessalinda, buster! "
11,37,268,JESSIE,"That Lumineon, perfect for someone beautiful, elegant, and refined like myself! "
11,37,269,JESSIE,And luring all kinds of Pokémon doesn't exactly hurt either! 
11,37,270,JESSIE,"I'll catch it, and then observe it, and write a report on it! You can just go find something else! "
11,37,271,ASH,"Don't you remember, it's against the rules to catch a Pokémon? "
11,37,272,DAWN,Of course! Professor Rowan said so! 
11,37,273,JESSIE,"Talk is cheap young lady, I catch whatever I want to catch! That's my rule! "
11,37,274,DAWN,You know Brock that sounds like a Team Rocket line. 
11,37,275,ANGIE,Hold on! We found that Lumineon first and you know it! 
11,37,276,JESSIE,Foolish talk from a loser! Yanmega let's go! 
11,37,277,YANMEGA,[APPEARING] 
11,37,278,ASH,You'll have to get through us! 
11,37,279,"DAWN, ANGIE",YEAH! 
11,37,280,CONWAY,Please! If you don't mind I'd like to handle this! 
11,37,281,CONWAY,"Dawn, I'll wage this battle for you! "
11,37,282,DAWN,Ohh kayy. 
11,37,283,CONWAY,Come forth. 
11,37,284,CONWAY,SLOWKING! 
11,37,285,SLOWKING,[APPEARING] 
11,37,286,JESSIE,Well! We're not the sharpest tool in the shed are we? 
11,37,287,CONWAY,Over-confidence can be bad for your health. 
11,37,288,JESSIE,Yanmega! Use Sonic Boom! 
11,37,289,YANMEGA,[SONIC BOOM MOVE] 
11,37,290,CONWAY,Quick Slowking! Protect! 
11,37,291,SLOWKING,[PROTECT MOVE] 
11,37,292,DAWN,Slowking's Protect's as strong as ever! 
11,37,293,CONWAY,How nice! I'm honored you remembered that! Thank you. I owe you one! 
11,37,294,CONWAY,"Which I intend to pay right now! Slowking, Water Pulse! "
11,37,295,SLOWKING,[WATER PULSE MOVE] 
11,37,296,YANMEGA,[STRUGGLING] 
11,37,297,YANMEGA,[REELING] 
11,37,298,JESSIE,"Don't take that from a dolt! Use Steel Wing, go! "
11,37,299,YANMEGA,[STEEL WING MOVE] 
11,37,300,CONWAY,"Protect, once more! "
11,37,301,SLOWKING,[PROTECT MOVE] 
11,37,302,YANMEGA,[STRUGGLING] 
11,37,303,SLOWKING,[DOMINATING] 
11,37,304,JESSIE,I'm too cute for this! 
11,37,305,CONWAY,Let's wrap this thing up! Psychic let's go! 
11,37,306,SLOWKING,[PSYCHIC MOVE] 
11,37,307,YANMEGA,[TRANSFIXED] 
11,37,308,ASH,Awesome! 
11,37,309,BROCK,That Psychic did the trick! 
11,37,310,JESSIE,"No! Don't do something, stand there! "
11,37,311,CONWAY,Not a chance! 
11,37,312,SLOWKING,[ATTACKING] 
11,37,313,YANMEGA,[REELING] 
11,37,314,"JESSIE, YANMEGA",[DAZED] 
11,37,315,MEOWTH,I guess that blows the treasure concept. 
11,37,316,JAMES,Enough blowing concepts for one day. 
11,37,317,"JAMES, MEOWTH, WOBBUFFET",[SAD] 
11,37,318,CONWAY,"Jessalinda, wait! Oh my. "
11,37,319,CONWAY,She's gone! 
11,37,320,DAWN,She's probably embarrassed right about now. 
11,37,321,ASH,So! Let's observe the Lumineon! 
11,37,322,"ANGIE, BROCK, DAWN",Right! 
11,37,323,ANGIE,What? The Lumineon's gone! 
11,37,324,DAWN,It may've gotten scared from all the noise and hid underwater! 
11,37,325,ASH,Okay Buizel! 
11,37,326,BUIZEL,[READY] 
11,37,327,ASH,Will you help us look for the Lumineon? 
11,37,328,BUIZEL,[AGREEING] 
11,37,329,DAWN,But keep an eye out for its blue light! 
11,37,330,ASH,We know that! 
11,37,331,ASH,Let's go! 
11,37,332,BROCK,What's this? 
11,37,333,DAWN,Did you find anything? 
11,37,334,ASH,Nope. Lumineon's gone. 
11,37,335,BUIZEL,[AGREEING] 
11,37,336,ASH,But we did see a tunnel at the bottom of the lake. It may've used that. 
11,37,337,ANGIE,A tunnel? 
11,37,338,BROCK,That's it! 
11,37,339,BROCK,"I would think that tunnel is probably connected to the ocean, you know? "
11,37,340,CONWAY,"That sounds like a logical assumption to me, Brock. "
11,37,341,BROCK,So maybe the Lumineon uses the tunnel to travel here from wherever it's living! 
11,37,342,CONWAY,But why in the world would it want to come here? 
11,37,343,BROCK,Look at this! 
11,37,344,BROCK,"That seaweed is a favorite of Water-type Pokémon, and it looks like a lot of it has been eaten. "
11,37,345,BROCK,"The thing is, I don't see a trace of any other Pokémon here. So the Lumineon must be the one eating it all! "
11,37,346,CONWAY,"Wow, excellent detective work! "
11,37,347,ANGIE,You figured that out just by looking. 
11,37,348,ASH,Of course! Anyone aiming to become top Pokémon Breeder's got to be smart! 
11,37,349,ANGIE,Awesome! 
11,37,350,DAWN,Sounds like we're going to give a great report! 
11,37,351,"ANGIE, ASH",Yeah! 
11,37,352,CONWAY,And don't forget my transcribing offer still stands. 
11,37,353,DAWN,Maybe that'll be fine! 
11,37,354,ASH,"Well, looks like the rain stopped. "
11,37,355,DAWN,"Hey, look up there! "
11,37,356,ALL,[CURIOUS] 
11,37,357,ANGIE,"Wow, what a gorgeous rainbow! "
11,37,358,ASH,Great! Time to head back! 
11,37,359,"ANGIE, DAWN, BROCK",Right! 
11,37,360,CONWAY,Not a sad face to be seen! 
11,37,361,ANGIE,And so... 
11,37,362,ANGIE,The Lumineon travels to the cave. 
11,37,363,ANGIE,Using an underwater tunnel as it makes its way from its home in the ocean. 
11,37,364,DAWN,Then it flashes a light from its four fins! 
11,37,365,ASH,And that powerful blue light has the ability to lure other Pokémon right to it! 
11,37,366,ANGIE,I know it because it lured my Shinx away into the cave! 
11,37,367,DAWN,It affected Pikachu and Piplup too! 
11,37,368,"PIKACHU, SHINX",[SHEEPISH] 
11,37,369,PIPLUP,[SMUG] 
11,37,370,DAWN,Stop! You don't have to be a showoff. 
11,37,371,BROCK,"So, from this, we can conclude that the Lumineon comes to the cave in order to eat the seaweed, which is proven Water-type Pokémon love to eat! "
11,37,372,DAWN,"And, with that we conclude our report. "
11,37,373,"PIKACHU, SHINX, PIPLUP",[JOYFUL] 
11,37,374,ROWAN,An exceptional report indeed. I give you all a full ten points! 
11,37,375,"BROCK, ASH, ANGIE, DAWN",All right! 
11,37,376,ROWAN,"However, you all left the lake area without asking permission. "
11,37,377,ROWAN,Do you have any idea how worried we were about you? 
11,37,378,YUZO,For breaking the rules we will subtract four points each. Which leaves you all with six points! 
11,37,379,"BROCK, ASH, ANGIE, DAWN",Thank you! 
11,37,380,JESSIE,"Of course, this is a good lesson for you kids! Now you know you can't just do what you want! "
11,37,381,YUZO,"Excuse me, but since you left the lake too you lose four points as well! "
11,37,382,JESSIE,So! Proving once again that you two schlubs aren't good for beans! 
11,37,383,"BOY A, BOY B","Sorry Ms. Jessalinda, sorry. "
11,37,384,YUZO,"Conway, I'm afraid you'll be losing four of your points too! "
11,37,385,CONWAY,Hey that's less than I expected! 
11,37,386,ROWAN,"So the Lumineon is back, eh? "
11,37,387,ROWAN,Albeit a little early this year. 
11,37,388,JESSIE,"Make those windows shine, spic and span! "
11,37,389,MALE STUDENTS,"Yes Ms. Jessalinda, right away! "
11,37,390,ASH,We got a perfect score but we still had four points taken off! 
11,37,391,ANGIE,"Look at the bright side, I mean we got to see the Lumineon! "
11,37,392,DAWN,It was so beautiful I couldn't believe it! -
11,37,393,BROCK,True! -
11,37,394,ASH,"Yeah, you're right! "
11,37,395,PIKACHU,[HAPPY] 
11,37,396,ASH,Sure hope we get to see Lumineon again.

11,33,127,GARY,"Just call it a good guess. Seems your training method leaves a little bit to be desired, Ashy boy! "
11,33,128,ASH,What was that? 
11,33,129,GARY,"Hey, I'm just offering you my help! "
11,33,130,ASH,Thanks but no thanks! Come on Gligar let's try it once more! 
11,33,131,GLIGAR,[SCARED] 
11,33,132,GARY,"Sounds like a ""no thank you"" to me! "
11,33,133,ASH,Oh yeah? Come on! 
11,33,134,"DAWN, BROCK, PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[SURPRISE] 
11,33,135,DAWN,Maybe you should take Gary up on his offer to help 
11,33,136,BROCK,Yeah. Just do it for Gligar. It might be best for everybody! 
11,33,137,GARY,Yeah! What have you got to lose? 
11,33,138,PIKACHU,[CONCERNED] 
11,33,139,UMBREON,[READY] 
11,33,140,GARY,It's Gligar against Umbreon! We'll be able to show you a few things! 
11,33,141,ASH,"We won't go easy on you! Now, Gligar, Steel Wing! "
11,33,142,GLIGAR,[STEEL WING MOVE] 
11,33,143,GARY,"Umbreon, Shadow Ball! "
11,33,144,UMBREON,[SHADOW BALL MOVE] 
11,33,145,GLIGAR,[SCARED] 
11,33,146,GLIGAR,[SCARED] 
11,33,147,GARY,I get it! Gligar freaks out easily when facing an opponent. 
11,33,148,GLIGAR,[NERVOUS] 
11,33,149,ASH,"But Gligar, you want to get strong? "
11,33,150,GLIGAR,[NERVOUS] 
11,33,151,BROCK,Even though Gligar wants to get strong as soon as any battling begins this huge wave of uncontrollable fear takes over! 
11,33,152,GARY,All right! So the first thing we have to work on is getting over that fear! 
11,33,153,DAWN,But how do you do that? 
11,33,154,ASH,You focus in and concentrate! 
11,33,155,GARY,"Ash, I guess you'll never change! "
11,33,156,GARY,"The most important thing about working with Steel Wing is to jump as high as you can! So if we can master that, no doubt Gligar will have lots more confidence in battle. "
11,33,157,DAWN,That's great! Gary sure gives instructions much better than Ash! 
11,33,158,ASH,I heard that! 
11,33,159,BROCK,But how does Gligar increase its jumping power? 
11,33,160,GARY,By using the end of Gligar's tail like a spring when it takes off! 
11,33,161,ASH,"Awesome! Okay Gligar, use the end of your tail like a spring when you jump! "
11,33,162,GLIGAR,[AGREE] 
11,33,163,ASH,"Now, Steel Wing, go! "
11,33,164,GLIGAR,[STEEL WING MOVE] 
11,33,165,ASH,What a jump! 
11,33,166,GLIGAR,[SURPRISE] 
11,33,167,GLIGAR,[YELP] 
11,33,168,"ASH, BROCK, DAWN, PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[SHOCK] 
11,33,169,PIKACHU,[CONCERN] 
11,33,170,DAWN,Oh no! 
11,33,171,BROCK,Now Gligar's got to deal with a fear of heights! 
11,33,172,GARY,We've got a problem all right. How much battling has Gligar done? 
11,33,173,DAWN,Not much Gligar got beaten pretty badly battling a Gliscor. Maybe that's why Gligar's so scared now. 
11,33,174,GARY,"Yeah, makes sense. A Gliscor. "
11,33,175,GARY,Hey! I know! We'll evolve Gligar! 
11,33,176,"ASH, GLIGAR, PIKACHU",[SHOCK] 
11,33,177,DAWN,What's that? 
11,33,178,PIPLUP,[INTERESTED] 
11,33,179,BROCK,It's a Razor Fang! 
11,33,180,GARY,Right! We'll just evolve Gligar into Gliscor with this! 
11,33,181,GARY,"And once we do that, all sorts of Gligar's abilities will improve, and we can put the brakes on all of that fear! "
11,33,182,ASH,"Wow, thanks Gary! "
11,33,183,GLIGAR,[EXCITED] 
11,33,184,ASH,"Calm down, Gligar. Evolving is no substitute for some honest hard work! You can evolve after you conquer your fear! "
11,33,185,GLIGAR,[SAD] 
11,33,186,GARY,What the! 
11,33,187,JESSIE,A clueless Twerp is certainly nothing new! 
11,33,188,JAMES,You're all pros at not having a clue! 
11,33,189,JESSIE,Face the facts! 
11,33,190,JAMES,For a change! 
11,33,191,MEOWTH,Stinks to be you! 
11,33,192,JESSIE,We'll bring chaos at a breakneck pace! 
11,33,193,JAMES,"We'll dash all hope, and put fear in its place! "
11,33,194,JESSIE,"So it's old home week for the Twerps, we see! "
11,33,195,JAMES,"But without us, you're short by three! "
11,33,196,JESSIE,Jessie! 
11,33,197,JAMES,And James! 
11,33,198,MEOWTH,"Meowth makes it triple, you see? "

11,33,213,ASH,Gligar's staying with me!

11,33,216,JESSIE,Brat! Always dragging us down!

11,33,228,ASH,"Gligar, you're not hurt are you? "
11,33,229,GLIGAR,[REASSURING] 
11,33,230,JAMES,Everyone should have a Gliscorbot! 
11,33,231,JESSIE,"We do, and that's what counts! Which leads to the need to speed Gligar by Delibird express to the Boss's digs! "
11,33,232,MEOWTH,"Once The Boss's dreaming without morning interruption, we'll be rolling fat! "
11,33,233,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,33,234,JAMES,"So! To mark the day's victory, I've taken the liberty of preparing a modest little meal, and here it is! "
11,33,235,JESSIE,Wow! Canned food with eight layers of cans! 
11,33,236,MEOWTH,There's nothing modest about a towering pile of tin! 
11,33,237,JAMES,"Quick, eat before we pass the expiration date! "
11,33,238,"JESSIE, MEOWTH, JAMES","Peel that tin, and let's dig in! "
11,33,239,DAWN,"We haven't found Ash and Gligar yet, and the sun's starting to go down. "
11,33,240,GARY,I know this terrain like the back of my hand. And there just aren't that many places around here where Team Rocket's balloon could have touched down. 
11,33,241,GARY,This way! 
11,33,242,DAWN,"Right behind you, Gary! "
11,33,243,PIPLUP,[DETERMINED]

11,32,45,ASH,Does that mean these Pokémon are all yours? 
11,32,46,BACKLOT,Correct! I've gathered quite a few Pokémon from here and there. They love to play in my Trophy Garden! 
11,32,47,DAWN,A garden? 
11,32,48,MONICA,That's where I ran into all of you when it started to rain! 
11,32,49,BACKLOT,"Quite beautiful, isn't it? Wish you could have one? "
11,32,50,MONICA,"Mister Backlot has opened up his property to all kinds of Pokémon Trainers, watchers and breeders alike! And when the weather is nice, they all play outside! Mister Backlot is a very generous man! "

11,32,79,BACKLOT,"That hungry Swinub lives in the forest near here! Lately, we've been getting more and more visits. "
11,32,80,BROCK,"So it's not your Pokémon, Mr. Backlot? "
11,32,81,BACKLOT,"No! My lovely garden's quite a draw for Swinub, and the Poffins don't hurt either. "
11,32,82,DAWN,Nothing like a little nap after a meal! 
11,32,83,MONICA,Sorry about this! I'll have some fresh Poffins ready for you all in no time! 
11,32,84,BACKLOT,"Now why don't all of you join us for a lovely dinner this evening? You can sleep here tonight, and then enjoy the gardens tomorrow! A great idea, I must say! "
11,32,85,ASH,Thank you so much Mister Backlot! We'd love to! 
11,32,86,MEOWTH,"Those first-class digs are crawling with cutie-pie Pokémon, and it's got Twerps, too! "
11,32,87,MEOWTH,It's the perfect setup for us to pocket those little puddings and Pikachu! 
11,32,88,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,32,89,JESSIE,But that Swinub stays put! 
11,32,90,JAMES,"Pragmatic! If that gorging little gormandizer got its pudgy little paws on our paltry provisions, we'd be eaten out of house and home in a Hearthome heartbeat! "
11,32,91,JESSIE,"Regardless of what you just said, I think we agree! Let's go! "
11,32,92,"ASH, BROCK, DAWN","Whoa, that was delicious! "

11,32,95,BROCK,"I feel like I'm pretty lucky, too! "
11,32,96,BACKLOT,"I would imagine you'd like to eat this way every day, now wouldn't you? "
11,32,97,MONICA,Excuse me. Dawn would you care for another cup of tea? 
11,32,98,DAWN,Thanks! I'd love one! I have a favor to ask you Monica: May I have the use of your kitchen later on? 
11,32,99,MONICA,Of course! But-what for? 
11,32,100,MONICA,I see! You're all making Poffins to give to your Pokémon! 
11,32,101,DAWN,"Now that I've got the right recipe, I can't make enough for Piplup and the whole g*ng! "
11,32,102,PIPLUP,[HAPPY] 
11,32,103,MONICA,Hold on! 
11,32,104,MONICA,"These are some berries from our garden. I think you'll discover if you add a few of these into your Poffin mixture, your Pokémon will thank you! "
11,32,105,DAWN,That's so awesome! Thank you! 
11,32,106,BROCK,"When it comes to tasty and healthy treats, anything Monica puts her seal of approval on has gotta be great! "

11,32,111,PIKACHU,[AGREEING] 
11,32,112,DAWN,Ash just won an amazing victory at the Pastoria Gym! 
11,32,113,MONICA,I'm impressed! That's great! 
11,32,114,DAWN,"I really admire all of Ash's success, but I'd like to become Top Coordinator someday! "
11,32,115,MONICA,What's that? 
11,32,116,DAWN,My Pokétch timer went off! The Poffin batter should be perfectly done! 
11,32,117,BROCK,Now we just pour it into the molds and let it cool! 
11,32,118,DAWN,Ready! 
11,32,119,PIPLUP,[OVERJOYED] 
11,32,120,MONICA,Look at that! Piplup sure looks excited! 
11,32,121,DAWN,"They really love them, but they're still no match for Brock's Poffins "

11,32,134,ASH,"Hey, I know they may not be the prettiest Poffins, but trust me they taste just fine! Kind of! "
11,32,135,PIKACHU,[CONCERNED] 
11,32,136,MONICA,"If I had to guess, I'd say Swinub prefers Dawn's Poffins! Wow! "
11,32,137,BROCK,I think your Poffin recipe's earned you a real fan! 
11,32,138,DAWN,Really? Swinub? 
11,32,139,SWINUB,[ENCOURAGING] 
11,32,140,DAWN,"In that case! Here, eat up! "

11,28,64,TYLER,"See, right up front I decided that I was gonna catch the very first Pokémon I ever managed to touch. "
11,28,65,TYLER,.and that was the Yanma you saw! 
11,28,66,TYLER,I've been chasing that Yanma for three whole days now but it always seems to get away from me. 
11,28,67,ASH,Three days?

11,28,125,DAWN,No luck huh? 
11,28,126,ASH,Team Rocket's gotta be around here! 
11,28,127,BROCK,"Well, the problem is there are lots of lakes and ponds around here and they could all be connected underwater. "
11,28,128,ASH,I can't believe what Team Rocket did! Stealing someone's first caught Pokémon! 
11,28,129,TYLER,And after trying and trying to catch Yanma for the past three days. 
11,28,130,ASH,"Hey, don't do that! "
11,28,131,ASH,You can't quit after one defeat! 
11,28,132,ASH,"Your journey's just started! Believe me, you're gonna have to deal with lots harder stuff than this! "
11,28,133,DAWN,Don't worry! You stick with it and I'm sure you and your Pippy are gonna be just fine! 
11,28,134,BROCK,Yeah this is certainly no time for you to give up! It's true once a Pokémon's captured that's that. So now's the perfect time to set your sights on a new Pokémon!

11,28,136,"DAWN, BROCK, TYLER, PIPPY",[SURPRISED]

11,28,141,TYLER,GREAT! 
11,28,142,DAWN,Tyler wait up! 
11,28,143,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",That's what we call a dishonest day's work! 
11,28,144,JAMES,Poaching pre-weakened Pokémon conserves energy! 
11,28,145,JESSIE,Doing our part to make the world a bit greener! 
11,28,146,MEOWTH,"And, the sooner we pass it onto the Boss, the sooner we stop taking a loss! "
11,28,147,MEOWTH,Over the river and through the woods the Boss's house we go. 
11,28,148,JESSIE,Ah! It's here! Team Rocket's Delibird! 
11,28,149,JAMES,Ahoy Delibird!

11,28,155,DELIBIRD,[HURRYING] 
11,28,156,MEOWTH,Give it to the Boss with my compliments! 
11,28,157,JAMES,And my compliments too! 
11,28,158,JESSIE,If you know what's good for you! 
11,28,159,MEOWTH,All of our past get-rich-quick schemes and we finally come up with a plotz-proof-plan! 
11,28,160,JAMES,Throw enough spaghetti against the wall and something's bound to stick! And nothing is stickier than success! 
11,28,161,JESSIE,By using repetitive motion to b*at the odds. We're becoming the Sinnoh slickers we were destined to be. 
11,28,162,STARAVIA,[ANNOUNCING] 
11,28,163,ASH,You lost track of Yanma didn't you? It is getting dark. 
11,28,164,DAWN,"Maybe we should just call it a day for now, don't you think? "
11,28,165,TYLER,This is the first time I ever camped out! 
11,28,166,ASH,And wait'll you get a taste of the way Brock cooks! 
11,28,167,DAWN,There's nothing like traveling with a good friend who's a great chef! 
11,28,168,PIKACHU,[AGREEING] 
11,28,169,TYLER,I see! 
11,28,170,TYLER,Awesome!

11,28,174,ASH,These're the Gym badges I've gotten in the Sinnoh region so far. 
11,28,175,TYLER,"These are great! Ash, good for you! "
11,28,176,DAWN,And take a look at the Pokémon Contest ribbons I've won! 
11,28,177,DAWN,Contest battles have their own unique style and they're fun too! 
11,28,178,TYLER,Sounds cool! 
11,28,179,TYLER,I was planning on competing in Gym Battles. 
11,28,180,TYLER,But Pokémon Contests sound great too! 
11,28,181,ASH,Hey! Tyler how'd you like to meet my Pokémon now? -
11,28,182,DAWN,And mine too! -
11,28,183,BROCK,Me three! 
11,28,184,TYLER,Would I? 
11,28,185,JESSIE,Yes sir I'd be tickled to serve as your Sinnoh Region Chief. It's all so wonderfully sudden! 
11,28,186,JAMES,"When the Boss offers James seconds, James always says yes! "
11,28,187,MEOWTH,I know just what the Boss'll say next: It's the least I can do to make Meowth and friends stinking rich! -
11,28,188,GIOVANNI,"Yes, what? -"
11,28,189,UNDERLING A,"A package! Special delivery that looks like it's from a Jessie, James, and Meowth! "
11,28,190,GIOVANNI,Jessie? And James? And Meowth? 
11,28,191,UNDERLING A,Team Rocket operatives based in the Sinnoh region I believe. 
11,28,192,GIOVANNI,"Here, my dear Persian. "
11,28,193,GIOVANNI,Like that? 
11,28,194,GIOVANNI,What is it? 
11,28,195,UNDERLING B,"It's a Poké Ball, Sir. "
11,28,196,PERSIAN,[HAPPY] 
11,28,197,SCANNER,"Poké Ball contents: Yanma. Its usable moves: Wing att*ck, Quick att*ck, Sonicboom, and Ancient Power. "
11,28,198,GIOVANNI,Our supply? 
11,28,199,UNDERLING A,"Sir, we recently acquired a large number of Yanma. "
11,28,200,PERSIAN,[HAPPY] 
11,28,201,UNDERLING A,"What shall we do, sir? "
11,28,202,GIOVANNI,Let's see. 
11,28,203,ASH,Tyler! Today that Yanma's gonna be yours! 
11,28,204,TYLER,All right! 
11,28,205,PIPPY,[EXCITED] 
11,28,206,BROCK,All done! 
11,28,207,DAWN,What's done? 
11,28,208,BROCK,What better way to attract that Yanma than by mixing the kind of fruit it loves into some Pokémon Food? 
11,28,209,TYLER,"Wow, Brock! That's a great idea! "
11,28,210,JAMES,I don't recall ever witnessing such a magnificent morning! 
11,28,211,MEOWTH,I'm gonna grin my whiskers off! 
11,28,212,JESSIE,I could drink the air! A perfect day to celebrate the satisfying feeling of a job well done! 
11,28,213,DELIBIRD,[ARRIVING] 
11,28,214,MEOWTH,Delibird at eleven o'clock! 
11,28,215,MEOWTH,Voila! Thanks! 
11,28,216,JAMES,This appears to be from Team Rocket Headquarters! 
11,28,217,MEOWTH,Maybe it's a thank-you gift from the Boss! 
11,28,218,JESSIE,Riches here we come! 
11,28,219,MEOWTH,I'll bet you dollars to donuts the Boss was so yeah yeah'd over that Yanma we sent him he sent us a power Pokémon in return! 
11,28,220,JAMES,Hidden within this Poké Ball... Lucario or Rampardos perhaps?! 
11,28,221,JESSIE,The suspense! 
11,28,222,JESSIE,I can wait no more. Out here on the double! 
11,28,223,YANMA,[APPEARING] 
11,28,224,YANMA,[LANDING] 
11,28,225,JESSIE,Will you get your haunches out of my hair? 
11,28,226,YANMA,[BUZZING] 
11,28,227,MEOWTH,Again with that head thing. 
11,28,228,JAMES,Either they all do that or this is the Yanma we gifted the Boss with! 
11,28,229,MEOWTH,Why would he spring for the return stamp? 
11,28,230,MEOWTH,"Of course! See, being such a benevolent Boss he decided to give us a great gift for giving him a great gift by sending us the same gift, get it? "
11,28,231,JESSIE,Gobs of greedy business world Bosses but our Boss is golden. 
11,28,232,JAMES,Putting his Teammates' needs ahead of his own! 
11,28,233,MEOWTH,The big guy can make you cry! 
11,28,234,JESSIE,So! Since I'm the catcher in this Pokéball game I think it should be mine! 
11,28,235,JAMES,That sounds fair and fine. 
11,28,236,JESSIE,But it somehow feels like the Boss got the short end of the stick. 
11,28,237,JAMES,"In that case, I'll simply catch an alternate Yanma earmarked exclusively for the Boss's private stock! "
11,28,238,MEOWTH,Cool! James you rock hard! 
11,28,239,"PIPPY, YANMA",[BATTLING]

11,28,259,MEOWTH,What do you Twerps think you're doing flaming our gorgeously gifted Yanma straight from the Boss? 
11,28,260,JAMES,It's that sort of insensitivity that needs to be repaid in spades! 
11,28,261,JESSIE,You best get prepared to dig deep! 
11,28,262,MEOWTH,Because I'm digging deep too! 
11,28,263,MEOWTH,Now feast on my Fury Swipes! 
11,28,264,JAMES,Carnivine! Action!

11,28,305,JAMES,Wait! 
11,28,306,JAMES,"In order for a Yanma to evolve into a Yanmega it needs to know Ancient Power, so when could Yanma have learned such? "
11,28,307,MEOWTH,I know! 
11,28,308,MEOWTH,I'll wager the Boss must of thrown in teaching Yanma Ancient Power as a bonus for us being us! 
11,28,309,"JAMES, JESSIE","Wow! Wow, to think he'd give those extra props for his peeps! "
11,28,310,JAMES,No doubt we've ascended to his A list in a big way!

11,28,350,JAMES,Though we are presently blasting off.

11,27,244,BROCK,"You know, Glaceon's a lot stronger now than before it evolved from Eevee! "
11,27,245,BROCK,Wonder how May's going to show it off? 
11,27,246,DAWN,"Piplup, Bubble Beam! "
11,27,247,PIPLUP,[BUBBLEBEAM MOVE] 
11,27,248,MAY,Dodge it and use Secret Power! 
11,27,249,GLACEON,[SECRET POWER MOVE] 
11,27,250,PIPLUP,[PAINED] 
11,27,251,DAWN,Piplup no! 
11,27,252,MARIAN,It looks like that Secret Power has Piplup paralyzed! 
11,27,253,PIPLUP,[STRUGGLING] 
11,27,254,DAWN,"Just relax, Piplup, and you'll be all right! "
11,27,255,ZOEY,Using Secret Power like that to show off Glaceon was great strategy. A smart move! 
11,27,256,ASH,Doesn't the effect of Secret Power change depending on where you happen to be? 
11,27,257,BROCK,"Right, but when you're on stage, it causes paralysis! "
11,27,258,MAY,"Ice Shard, go! "
11,27,259,GLACEON,[ICE SHARD MOVE] 
11,27,260,PIPLUP,[WORRIED] 
11,27,261,MARIAN,"Ice Shard, beautiful! And powerful as well! "

11,27,264,GLACEON,[CONFIDENT] 
11,27,265,"BROCK, ASH, ZOEY, BUIZEL, PIKACHU, PACHIRISU",[SHOCKED] 
11,27,266,PIPLUP,[STUNNED] 
11,27,267,PIPLUP,[DETERMINED] 
11,27,268,MARIAN,And Piplup recovers! 
11,27,269,MAY,Now that's how you use a water b*ttlefield! 
11,27,270,DAWN,"Okay, Piplup, Whirlpool! "
11,27,271,PIPLUP,[WHIRLPOOL MOVE] 
11,27,272,MARIAN,And it's another powerful Whirlpool! Piplup's water control is incredible! What a great way to show off! 
11,27,273,MAY,Nice going! 
11,27,274,MAY,But I think it's time to grab some of that power! Mirror Coat! 
11,27,275,GLACEON,[MIRROR COAT MOVE] 
11,27,276,MARIAN,Mirror Coat's reflecting back that Whirlpool! 
11,27,277,MARIAN,Returning the damage Glaceon took! 
11,27,278,MARIAN,Times two! 
11,27,279,PIPLUP,[PAINED] 
11,27,280,DAWN,You okay? 
11,27,281,PIPLUP,[CONFIDENT] 
11,27,282,DAWN,"Bubble Beam, now! "
11,27,283,PIPLUP,[BUBBLEBEAM MOVE] 
11,27,284,GLACEON,[STRUGGLING] 
11,27,285,MARIAN,And Piplup att*cks with a speedy Bubble Beam! 
11,27,286,MAY,Shadow Ball! 
11,27,287,GLACEON,[SHADOW BALL MOVE] 
11,27,288,DAWN,"Piplup, spin and dodge! "
11,27,289,PIPLUP,[EFFORT] 
11,27,290,MAY,"Wow, what a beautiful dodge! But now. "
11,27,291,MAY,I'll take that water! 
11,27,292,MAY,"Glaceon, Secret Power! "
11,27,293,GLACEON,[SECRET POWER MOVE] 
11,27,294,DAWN,Secret Power again? 
11,27,295,PIPLUP,[QUESTIONING] 
11,27,296,ASH,So what will it do this time? 
11,27,297,PIKACHU,[CONCERNED] 
11,27,298,DAWN,"Dodge it, quick! "
11,27,299,PIPLUP,[WORRIED] 
11,27,300,MARIAN,"Glaceon's so fast, even Piplup can't dodge in time! "
11,27,301,DAWN,"Quick, snap out of it! "
11,27,302,PIPLUP,[DETERMINED] 
11,27,303,"MAY, GLACEON",[SURPRISED] 
11,27,304,MARIAN,"And Secret Power misses its mark, as a defiant Piplup takes almost zero damage! "
11,27,305,BROCK,And that's because the effects of Secret Power are somewhat random! 
11,27,306,ZOEY,"In a puddle of water, its added effect may be sleep, but otherwise it's like using Tackle! "
11,27,307,MAY,"All right, try this! Glaceon, Shadow Ball! "
11,27,308,GLACEON,[SHADOW BALL MOVE] 
11,27,309,MARIAN,And Glaceon puts everything into that Shadow Ball! What a dynamic display of power! 
11,27,310,DAWN,"Bubble Beam, go! "
11,27,311,PIPLUP,[BUBBLEBEAM MOVE] 
11,27,312,GLACEON,[STRUGGLING] 
11,27,313,MARIAN,And that Shadow Ball's neutralized! 
11,27,314,MARIAN,"Plus, the Bubble Beam's got Glaceon trapped! "
11,27,315,DAWN,"Piplup, use Peck! "
11,27,316,PIPLUP,[PECK MOVE] 
11,27,317,MAY,"Dodge it, then use Ice Shard! "
11,27,318,PIPLUP,[SURPRISED] 
11,27,319,GLACEON,[ICE SHARD MOVE] 
11,27,320,DAWN,Whirlpool! 
11,27,321,PIPLUP,[WHIRLPOOL MOVE] 
11,27,322,MARIAN,"Wow, Piplup's using Whirlpool as a perfect defense against that Ice Shard! "
11,27,323,MARIAN,We've got equal points by both Coordinators. 
11,27,324,MARIAN,and with just one minute left on the clock! 
11,27,325,DAWN,"Ride the Whirlpool, now! "
11,27,326,PIPLUP,[EFFORT] 
11,27,327,MARIAN,And the sight of Piplup fearlessly riding that Whirlpool has left the audience simply breathless! 
11,27,328,ASH,"That's it, show them, May and Dawn! "
11,27,329,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
11,27,330,MAY,Shadow Ball!

11,27,339,DAWN,"Piplup, use Peck! "
11,27,340,PIPLUP,[PECK MOVE] 
11,27,341,MAY,"Glaceon, Ice Shard! "
11,27,342,GLACEON,[ICE SHARD MOVE] 
11,27,343,PIPLUP,[PAINED] 
11,27,344,MARIAN,And May answers back with a terrific Ice Shard! 
11,27,345,DAWN,"Great, May, nice work! "
11,27,346,MAY,"Back at you, Dawn! "
11,27,347,DAWN,Tiny little att*cks aren't going to work against May. so in that case. 
11,27,348,MAY,There isn't much time left. I know Dawn's coming in with a big att*ck! 
11,27,349,DAWN,"Let's decide it now! Piplup! Whirlpool, go! "
11,27,350,PIPLUP,[WHIRLPOOL MOVE] 
11,27,351,MAY,Aha! Use Mirror Coat! 
11,27,352,GLACEON,[MIRROR COAT MOVE]

11,27,354,"PIPLUP, GLACEON",[PAINED] 
11,27,355,MARIAN,That's it! Time's up!

11,27,357,"BROCK, ASH, ZOEY, BUIZEL, PIKACHU, PACHIRISU",[ANXIOUS] 
11,27,358,MARIAN,That was a perfect final stage! 
11,27,359,MARIAN,A tough-as-nails battle! 
11,27,360,MARIAN,Heated and beautiful as well! 
11,27,361,MARIAN,You all know winner takes all. 
11,27,362,MARIAN,"So, without further ado, the winning Coordinator of the Wallace Cup is. Dawn, with her Piplup! "

11,27,367,BROCK,That was a great battle by both of them! 
11,27,368,ZOEY,And they really made their Pokémon shine! 
11,27,369,MAY,"Now, Glaceon, don't feel bad! You were completely wonderful! "

11,26,4,MAY,So you've wanted to be a Coordinator since you were little? 
11,26,5,ZOEY,"Hey, May, what about you? "
11,26,6,MAY,"Well, let's just say in the beginning I had a little trouble dealing with Pokémon at all. But after I started learning about contests and found out how much fun they were, I was hooked! "

11,26,25,ASH,Brock! 
11,26,26,ASH,"In Lake Valor! It was shining! It was spinning! And then, all of a sudden, whoosh! "

11,26,28,BROCK,Slow down! I don't have a clue what you just said! 
11,26,29,DAWN,What's wrong? 
11,26,30,PIPLUP,[CONCERNED] 
11,26,31,ASH,"The thing! In Lake Valor! It was glowing, and then, whoosh! It disappeared! I've got no idea what it was! "
11,26,32,PIPLUP,[BUBBLE BEAM MOVE] 
11,26,33,DAWN,"Okay, now it's your turn to wake up! "
11,26,34,ASH,"Okay, I'm fine! No more! "
11,26,35,BROCK,"Let's see. You say you saw some kind of strange light in Lake Valor, is that right? "
11,26,36,ASH,"Yeah, but it's like the light was alive or something like that! What did you think, Pikachu? "
11,26,37,PIKACHU,[AGREEMENT] 
11,26,38,PIPLUP,[AMAZED] 
11,26,39,DAWN,"Whoa, the same thing happened to me! "
11,26,40,DAWN,"Yeah, I thought I told you about it "
11,26,41,DAWN,It happened on the first day I met Piplup! I was at Lake Verity and saw a strange shadow! 
11,26,42,DAWN,Professor Rowan's always said that there was a Legendary Pokémon living in Lake Verity. Wow Sounds to me like you and I had the same kind of experience! 
11,26,43,ASH,"Pikachu, do you think maybe we saw a Legendary Pokémon? "
11,26,44,PIKACHU,[AMAZED] 
11,26,45,MAY,"Hey, that reminds me. We heard a story like that when we were in Snowpoint City! "
11,26,46,MAY,"Right around that area, there's a lake there that's called Lake Acuity "
11,26,47,MAY,And there are all these rumors saying a mysterious Pokémon lives there! 
11,26,48,BROCK,"Another lake, huh? "
11,26,49,ZOEY,"Well, I know what May's telling us is the truth! You see, I'm from Snowpoint City, and I used to hear those stories when I was young! "
11,26,50,DAWN,"Wow! Zoey, that's amazing! "
11,26,51,ZOEY,The legend of the mysterious Lake Acuity Pokémon is well known around there! It speaks of a shadowy figure emerging on the surface of the water from time to time while it patrols the lake. 
11,26,52,ZOEY,It's the same type of legend in both Lake Valor and Lake Verity. 
11,26,53,BROCK,"If they're Legendary Pokémon, all of these sightings and stories just might have something to do with the Sinnoh Space-Time Legend. "
11,26,54,DAWN,I'm going to get in touch with Professor Rowan in the morning and ask him first thing! 
11,26,55,MARIAN,"Ladies and gentlemen, we're back at the Wallace Cup for the beginning of our second-stage Contest Battles! "
11,26,56,MARIAN,"So, Wallace, would you mind saying a few words to our remaining Coordinators? "
11,26,57,WALLACE,"I bid all of you lovely Coordinators hello! It's time to bring your excitement and your passion to the world, and I thank you all! "
11,26,58,MARIAN,"In a Pokémon Contest Battle, Coordinators have five minutes to show off their Pokémon's moves "

11,26,64,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
11,26,65,MARIAN,"And now, our second-stage matchups will be determined by a random shuffle of the contest computer! "
11,26,66,MARIAN,And here they are! Presenting the second-round matchup cards! 
11,26,67,DAWN,Looks like I'm first. 
11,26,68,PIPLUP,[AFFIRMATIVE]

11,26,75,PIPLUP,[ENCOURAGING] 
11,26,76,DAWN,Got it! 
11,26,77,ZOEY,"Nothing like getting through the first stage to give Dawn some much-needed confidence, you know? "
11,26,78,BROCK,"Now, if she can hold on to that confidence! That's what she needs to get good at. "
11,26,79,MARIAN,Time for our first battle! We've got five minutes on the clock! Let's go!

11,26,89,BUNEARY,[EXCITED] 
11,26,90,WAILMER BOY,Hey! That's no fair! 
11,26,91,MARIAN,Buneary's cleverly used the energy from that Brine to do some backward somersaults! 
11,26,92,MARIAN,I can't take my eyes off of such cute and dynamic moves! 
11,26,93,WALLACE,"Why, that's just fabulous! "
11,26,94,DAWN,"Now Buneary, use Bounce! "
11,26,95,BUNEARY,[BOUNCE MOVE]

11,26,97,BUNEARY,[TRIUMPHANT] 
11,26,98,WAILMER BOY,"Quick! Use Surf, now! "
11,26,99,WAILMER ,[SURF MOVE]

11,26,121,BUNEARY,[CHEERING] 
11,26,122,DAWN,"Ice Beam, now! "
11,26,123,BUNEARY,[ICE BEAM MOVE] 
11,26,124,WAILMER BOY,Body Slam! 
11,26,125,WAILMER,[BODY SLAM MOVE] 
11,26,126,MARIAN,Look out! Time's up! 
11,26,127,MARIAN,And the winner of the first battle is Dawn and Buneary! 
11,26,128,DAWN,Yahoo! 
11,26,129,CONTESTA,The wonderful combination of Buneary's elegant footwork and moves was powerful and effective! 
11,26,130,SUKIZO,"And don't forget remarkable, either! "
11,26,131,JOY,It was honestly enthralling to see both Buneary and Wailmer in such great form out there! 
11,26,132,WALLACE,"That was powerful and delicate. A perfect blend! I have high hopes for the next battle, too! "
11,26,133,DAWN,"Buneary, thanks so much! You were just great! "
11,26,134,BUNEARY,[PLEASED] 
11,26,135,ASH,"Whoa, Dawn won it like I told her to! "
11,26,136,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
11,26,137,BROCK,Obviously choosing Buneary was the right thing to do! 
11,26,138,BROCK,"Buneary's fancy footwork really lifted up the audience's spirits, to say nothing of Dawn's spirits! "
11,26,139,ZOEY,"Well, since Dawn was enjoying herself, the audience couldn't help it! "
11,26,140,MAY,"The bar's been raised. Now we have to win, too, right? -"
11,26,141,ASH,Right! -
11,26,142,MARIAN,"All right, folks! It's time for the second of our Contest Battles! "
11,26,143,BUIZEL,[EFFORT] 
11,26,144,KECLEON,[PAINED] 
11,26,145,ZOEY,"Shellos, Mud b*mb! "
11,26,146,SKITTY,[EXCITED] 
11,26,147,ORANGE TRAINER,Exeggutor! 
11,26,148,JESSIE,Sideline-sitting seems so sad to a fallen star 
11,26,149,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,26,150,WOBBUFFET,[SHEEPISH] 
11,26,151,JAMES,Just remember the old saying. You can't win them all! 
11,26,152,MEOWTH,"Anything we can do for you, kid? "
11,26,153,JESSIE,You bet! You can wave a magic wand and waft me back down there to where the action is! 
11,26,154,JAMES,What a coincidence! We were just perusing that precisely pinpointed premise! 
11,26,155,MEOWTH,And that's when we came up with a creative idea! 
11,26,156,JESSIE,You two? 
11,26,157,JAMES,Rumor has it they're short on reporters. 
11,26,158,MEOWTH,So we thought you could get back to doing your reporterette shtick and rock the house! 
11,26,159,JESSIE,Memories of the way we were. I'll do what any great actress would do when asked! 
11,26,160,JESSIE,"That's fake the news! Yessiree, where there's a scoop, pretty Jessedia will spin it! "
11,26,161,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,26,162,MARIAN,And that means time's up! 
11,26,163,"DAWN, PACHIRISU",[SHOCKED] 
11,26,164,MARIAN,"The second battle of the second stage is now history, and Dawn will be moving on to the semifinals! "
11,26,165,DAWN,"Wow, we did it! Thanks, Pachirisu! "
11,26,166,PACHIRISU,[EXCITED] 
11,26,167,ASH,Awesome! The second stage! 
11,26,168,"PIPLUP, PIKACHU",[EXCITED] 
11,26,169,MAY,Pachirisu was just great! 
11,26,170,ZOEY,It sure is going well for Dawn! 
11,26,171,BROCK,Ash! Looks like you're up next! 
11,26,172,ASH,Right! 
11,26,173,PIKACHU,[ENCOURAGING] 
11,26,174,ASH,Thanks! 
11,26,175,MARIAN,Time for the next battle of the second stage! 
11,26,176,MARIAN,"On my right, it's Ash! "
11,26,177,MARIAN,"And on my left, it's Kyle! "
11,26,178,MARIAN,We're set for five minutes. Let's go! 
11,26,179,ASH,"Ta-da! Buizel, I choose you! "
11,26,180,BUIZEL,[APPEARING] 
11,26,181,KYLE,Lanturn! You're up! 
11,26,182,LANTURN,[APPEARING] 
11,26,183,MARIAN,Oh my! Kyle has chosen his Lanturn to go up against Ash's Buizel! 
11,26,184,DAWN,So that's a Lanturn 
11,26,185,POKEDEX,"Lanturn. The Light Pokémon, and the evolved form of Chinchou. Lanturn's antenna light is strong enough to penetrate the ocean and can be seen on the water's surface. "
11,26,186,BROCK,No doubt Lanturn's going to be one tough opponent! 
11,26,187,ZOEY,"Yeah! Lanturn's not just a Water type, it's an Electric type, too! "
11,26,188,DAWN,But I'm still sure Ash and Buizel will win! 
11,26,189,PIPLUP,[HAPPY] 
11,26,190,KYLE,"Now, Lanturn! Use Charge! "
11,26,191,LANTURN,[CHARGE MOVE] 
11,26,192,MARIAN,And a terrific kickoff to show Lanturn's unique position as a Water type with strong Electric-type abilities! 
11,26,193,ZOEY,Lanturn showing off those amazing electric powers has really put the pressure on Ash! 
11,26,194,MAY,"Yeah, using Lanturn's antenna to do that is brilliant! This Coordinator is awfully good! "
11,26,195,PIPLUP,[CONCERNED] 
11,26,196,PIKACHU,[CONCERNED] 
11,26,197,ASH,"I think we'll use that glowing water, too! Buizel, Sonic Boom! "
11,26,198,BUIZEL,[SONIC BOOM MOVE] 
11,26,199,MARIAN,Buizel launches a powerful Sonic Boom 
11,26,200,MARIAN,throwing Lanturn high up into the air! 
11,26,201,LANTURN,[THREATENING] 
11,26,202,ASH,"Oh, no, not that! "
11,26,203,KYLE,"And, if you don't mind, I think we'll use your Sonic Boom as well! Now, Thunderbolt! "
11,26,204,LANTURN,[THUNDERBOLT MOVE] 
11,26,205,BUIZEL,[PAINED] 
11,26,206,ASH,"Oh, man. No, Buizel! "
11,26,207,MARIAN,And Lanturn unleashes a powerful Thunderbolt counterattack in midair! 
11,26,208,BROCK,Charge increases the power of the next Electric-type move! I'm afraid Buizel's taken a serious amount of damage from that Thunderbolt! 
11,26,209,PIKACHU,[DETERMINED] 
11,26,210,BUIZEL,[DAZED] 
11,26,211,LANTURN,[TAUNTING] 
11,26,212,KYLE,"The other Coordinators switched Pokémon after round one, but you kept your Buizel in there the whole time! So I can predict exactly what you're going to do! "
11,26,213,ASH,"Why, that little "
11,26,214,BUIZEL,[ANNOYED] 
11,26,215,KYLE,"All right, Ice Beam, go! "
11,26,216,LANTURN,[ICE BEAM MOVE] 
11,26,217,MARIAN,"Those two are showing off even while f*ring an Ice Beam! In air or in the water, Lanturn is looking fantastic! "
11,26,218,ASH,"Okay, go for it! Use Aqua Jet! "
11,26,219,BUIZEL,[AQUA JET MOVE] 
11,26,220,MARIAN,Is Buizel using Aqua Jet to fire directly at that Ice Beam?! 
11,26,221,DAWN,Ash is really doing that?! 
11,26,222,PIPLUP,[AMAZED] 
11,26,223,ASH,"All right, Buizel, now spin! "
11,26,224,BUIZEL,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,26,225,KYLE,What are those two up to? 
11,26,226,WALLACE,What's this? 
11,26,227,MARIAN,This is beyond incredible! 
11,26,228,LANTURN,[SHOCKED] 
11,26,229,KYLE,I've never seen this before! 
11,26,230,ASH,"Use Ice Aqua Jet, and take it all the way! "
11,26,231,KYLE,"Lanturn! Thunderbolt, hurry! "
11,26,232,LANTURN,[THUNDERBOLT MOVE] 
11,26,233,BUIZEL,[EFFORT] 
11,26,234,LANTURN,[PAINED] 
11,26,235,MARIAN,An Ice Aqua Jet. Wow! 
11,26,236,ASH,"Way to go, Buizel! "
11,26,237,DAWN,A fusion move! He did it! 
11,26,238,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
11,26,239,ZOEY,Talk about surprise! Ash is really a piece of work! 
11,26,240,BROCK,"Actually, that Ice Aqua Jet was originally Dawn's idea! "
11,26,241,MAY,"It was? Wow, Dawn, you're amazing, too! "
11,26,242,DAWN,"Well, it took Ash's touch to get it to actually work! "
11,26,243,KYLE,"Hydro Pump, go! "
11,26,244,LANTURN,[HYDRO PUMP MOVE] 
11,26,245,BUIZEL,[PAINED] 
11,26,246,MARIAN,And a powerful Hydro Pump sends Buizel flying! 
11,26,247,BUIZEL,[DETERMINED] 
11,26,248,ASH,Now use Water Pulse to counterattack! 
11,26,249,BUIZEL,[WATER PULSE MOVE] 
11,26,250,KYLE,"All right, Thunderbolt! "
11,26,251,LANTURN,[THUNDERBOLT MOVE] 
11,26,252,LANTURN,[TRIUMPHANT] 
11,26,253,MARIAN,Time's up! 
11,26,254,MARIAN,"And going on to the semifinals, it's Kyle! "
11,26,255,KYLE,All right! 
11,26,256,ASH,"Oh, man "
11,26,257,CONTESTA,Quite simply one impressive Contest Battle move after another! 
11,26,258,SUKIZO,"Of course. Not to mention, remarkable! "
11,26,259,JOY,One of the most thrilling and powerful battles I've ever seen! 
11,26,260,WALLACE,This bout between powerful electric moves and that Ice Aqua Jet demonstrated total mastery of the Contest Battle! 
11,26,261,DAWN,Too bad. And after completing that fantastic Ice Aqua Jet. 
11,26,262,PIKACHU,[SAD] 
11,26,263,PIPLUP,[SAD] 
11,26,264,MAY,"Well, it was a great battle anyway. "
11,26,265,BROCK,Ash really went for it with that Ice Aqua Jet and showed off Buizel well at the same time. 
11,26,266,ZOEY,Ash was on the defensive with Kyle's display of Electric-type moves! That's where experience really counts. 
11,26,267,JESSIE,Hi! I'm out here interviewing Coordinators who have already bit the contest dust! 
11,26,268,ASH,Okay 
11,26,269,JESSIE,"Tough break, kid! But your Ice Aqua Jet is the talk of the contest! Even Wallace was knocked out! To be a loser while managing to make a good impression is really something! "
11,26,270,ASH,"Thanks, but I didn't make it up. "
11,26,271,JESSIE,"Well, isn't that special! This has been Jessedia, your perky and provocatively cute roving reporter! Back to you! "
11,26,272,ZOEY,"Misdreavus! Double Team, now! "
11,26,273,MAY,"Great, Venusaur! Keep it going! "
11,26,274,JESSIE,Update on the third and fourth second-stage bouts! It has now been confirmed that Zoey and May have won successive matches and move on to the semifinals. Isn't that nice? 
11,26,275,JESSIE,And that means I'll bring you a scoop full of semifinals tomorrow! 
11,26,276,JESSIE,And we'll all see who gets the Aqua Ribbon together! 
11,26,277,JESSIE,"Till then, toodle-oo! "
11,26,278,MEOWTH,We're clear! 
11,26,279,JESSIE,"So, g*ng, was I gorgeous or what? "
11,26,280,JAMES,You're the apple of the fanbase eye! 
11,26,281,JESSIE,Tacky flattery will get you everywhere! 
11,26,282,MARIAN,"Just great, Jessedia! "
11,26,283,JESSIE,Thanks! One of us needs to be. 
11,26,284,MARIAN,So I heard through the TV grapevine that you were an assistant reporter at the Kanto Grand Festival as well! Thank you. You really helped us out in a pinch! 
11,26,285,JESSIE,"Well, if you ever need a professional pinching again, you give Jessedia a jingle! "
11,26,286,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,26,287,BROCK,"Sorry, Ash, tough break "
11,26,288,PIPLUP,[SAD] 
11,26,289,PIKACHU,[SAD] 
11,26,290,DAWN,"But I have to tell you, Ash, you pulled off that Ice Aqua Jet perfectly! "
11,26,291,MAY,Yeah! It was an amazing sight to see! 
11,26,292,ASH,"It was so weird at that moment, I thought we won! "
11,26,293,ASH,"Man, Contest Battles are a lot tougher than I thought. "
11,26,294,BUIZEL,[SAD] 
11,26,295,ASH,"On the other hand, Buizel and I were moving in perfect sync out there! Just think of how much better we're gonna battle the next time around! "
11,26,296,BUIZEL,[DETERMINED] 
11,26,297,ASH,"Starting tomorrow, you leave the cheering section to me! "
11,26,298,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
11,26,299,BROCK,"Easier said than done, Ash! Remember, it's going to be May and Zoey battling each other to get to those finals. And let's not forget Dawn's planning on getting to the finals as well "
11,26,300,ASH,"Yeah, you're right, Brock! "
11,26,301,PIKACHU,[AGREEMENT] 
11,26,302,DAWN,"Whoa, so that means if I get to the finals, then "
11,26,303,MAY,Then you're just going to have to face one of us! 
11,26,304,ZOEY,"Well, hasn't this gotten interesting? "
11,26,305,BROCK,Sure has! Can't wait for tomorrow! 
11,26,306,ASH,It's a battle to the finish between best friends! 
11,26,307,PIKACHU,[AMAZED] 
11,26,308,ZOEY,"Best friends or not, I'm getting the Aqua Ribbon! "
11,26,309,MAY,That's my line! 
11,26,310,DAWN,"Friends are forever, but so is winning the Wallace Cup! "
11,26,311,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
11,26,312,MARIAN,"And so the final day of the Wallace Cup begins! Please, Wallace, a few words! "

11,26,331,ZOEY,"You've got it, May! We'd better keep a close eye on both their battle styles! "
11,26,332,DAWN,"Ready to go, Piplup? "
11,26,333,DAWN,"All right, then use Bubble Beam! "
11,26,334,PIPLUP,[BUBBLE BEAM MOVE]

11,24,24,PIPLUP,[HAPPY] 
11,24,25,DAWN,It's adorable! 
11,24,26,DAWN,"I finally get to meet you after all this time! They call you the Princess of Hoenn, right? "
11,24,27,MAY,"Stop! You're making me blush! Call me May, okay? "
11,24,28,ASH,Guess we have Wallace to thank for seeing you again! 
11,24,29,BROCK,So are you all ready to compete in the Wallace Cup? 
11,24,30,MAY,Yeah! I've been waiting to do this for such a long time! And as soon as I heard it was going to be in Sinnoh I came here as fast as I could! 
11,24,31,JAMES,Could that be the Hoenn region Twerpette? 
11,24,32,JESSIE,Back for a whirl at the Wallace Cup competition I'll bet. 
11,24,33,MEOWTH,How competitive can it get? 
11,24,34,WOBBUFFET,[CONCERNED] 
11,24,35,JESSIE,I'll totally trounce her don't you fret! 
11,24,36,"JESSIE, MEOWTH, WOBBUFFET",[WEAK] 
11,24,37,JAMES,If I don't get something to eat pretty soon I'll have no fuel to fret! 
11,24,38,WOBBUFFET,[WEAK] 
11,24,39,ASH,So what's Max up to these days? 
11,24,40,DAWN,"Oh yeah! Max is your little brother right, May? "
11,24,41,MAY,Right! Max is doing great! 
11,24,42,MAY,He's hard at work helping to take care of Dad's Pokémon. Max's always talking about doing it just like he learned from Brock! Needless to say Dad's as proud as he can be! 
11,24,43,BROCK,That's nice to hear! 
11,24,44,ASH,Of course! Max was always watching Brock super closely! 
11,24,45,PIKACHU,[AGREEING] 
11,24,46,DAWN,"That's amazing! So May, when did you arrive in Sinnoh? "
11,24,47,MAY,Three days ago. There was something I really wanted to do before the Wallace Cup got started. So first I went to Snowpoint City! 
11,24,48,DAWN,So what did you do? 
11,24,49,MAY,"I'll show you! Now! Glaceon, on stage! "
11,24,50,GLACEON,[APPEARING] 
11,24,51,BROCK,"May, your Eevee evolved! Great! "
11,24,52,POKEDEX,Glaceon. The Fresh Snow Pokémon and an evolved form of Eevee. Glaceon can freeze the fur on its body and make it stick out like sharp needles. 
11,24,53,DAWN,So cute! 
11,24,54,MAY,"See, over near Snowpoint City there's an ice cave "
11,24,55,MAY,where a huge ice crystal causes Eevee to evolve! 
11,24,56,DAWN,and where your Eevee evolved. 
11,24,57,MAY,Right! 
11,24,58,MAY,"Since I was coming to Sinnoh anyway, I figured it would be fun to return to the Johto Contests with a newly evolved Pokémon! "
11,24,59,ASH,"Oh yeah, how many Johto ribbons do you have by now? "
11,24,60,MAY,I've got three of them! 
11,24,61,DAWN,Three? Nice work! 
11,24,62,MAY,"Thanks! But, as usual... "
11,24,63,MAY,Drew and Harley are as strong as ever and I just can't seem to b*at either of them! 
11,24,64,ASH,Sounds like you're really working hard! 
11,24,65,DAWN,May would you mind showing me your ribbons? 
11,24,66,MAY,Here! 
11,24,67,MAY,Ta da! 
11,24,68,DAWN,Real Johto ribbons! 
11,24,69,MAY,Ash told me all about you! 
11,24,70,ASH,"Yup, everything! "
11,24,71,PIKACHU,[HAPPY] 
11,24,72,BROCK,She knows all about how you lost in the first stage twice in a row and that right now you're recharging a bit! -
11,24,73,DAWN,Oh! -
11,24,74,MAY,"Hey, chin up! Since I got to Johto it's been one disaster after another for me! "
11,24,75,DAWN,"Wow, you too? "
11,24,76,MAY,So I wanted to compete in the Wallace Cup as a good way to get myself back on the Contest track! Why don't we both make this our comeback stage? 
11,24,77,DAWN,It's a deal! 
11,24,78,"ASH, BROCK, MAY, DAWN, PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[CONFUSED] 
11,24,79,MAY,Some things never change! 
11,24,80,ASH,Guess I have been kind of hungry for a while now. 
11,24,81,DAWN,Well since it's lunchtime we're probably all hungry! 
11,24,82,MAY,I just happened to make reservations at the perfect place! Only the most popular restaurant in Valor Lakefront! 
11,24,83,ASH,This is it? 
11,24,84,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
11,24,85,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
11,24,86,MAY,The Seven Stars Restaurant! This is the hottest place to eat in the whole Sinnoh region! 
11,24,87,DAWN,"Wow, May, I'm impressed! "
11,24,88,BROCK,May's always had a nose for finding great places like this! 
11,24,89,JESSIE,How dare the Twerps have a fine feast when we're starving! 
11,24,90,MEOWTH,"You know, for dopes they don't do so bad! "
11,24,91,JAMES,That's because while we came to become Contest conquerors they chose to chow down! 
11,24,92,WOBBUFFET,[UPSET] 
11,24,93,CONCIERGE,Welcome ladies and gentlemen! 
11,24,94,MAY,Reservations for May? 
11,24,95,CONCIERGE,"Yes of course we've been waiting for you, Miss May. You have a reservation for four! Please, right this way! "
11,24,96,CONCIERGE,You're leaving? 
11,24,97,BOY,I'm gonna go back and train some more but I'm gonna eat here if it's the last thing I do! 
11,24,98,CONCIERGE,Then we'll be waiting to serve you at another time. 
11,24,99,BOY,I won't forget this! 
11,24,100,DAWN,What was that about? 
11,24,101,CONCIERGE,That young man lost his battle so of course he wasn't accepted at our establishment. -
11,24,102,ASH,Battle? -
11,24,103,CONCIERGE,Come with me and I'll explain. 
11,24,104,"BROCK, ASH, DAWN, PIKACHU",[SHOCKED] 
11,24,105,ASH,It's a b*ttlefield! 
11,24,106,DAWN,I thought it was a restaurant! 
11,24,107,CONCIERGE,"You see, besides being a wealthy and successful businessman, the owner of the Seven Stars restaurant is an avid battle fan as well! "
11,24,108,CONCIERGE,"As a result, only those who battle against him and his fiancée and emerge victoriously are allowed to dine here! "
11,24,109,"ASH, DAWN, BROCK, PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[SHOCKED] 
11,24,110,BROCK,"That means, if we lose... "
11,24,111,CONCIERGE,You'll be leaving with empty stomachs just like the last gentleman did. 
11,24,112,DAWN,That's rough! 
11,24,113,MAY,Nah! I think it's great! 
11,24,114,ASH,If you say so. I'm starving! 
11,24,115,"ASH, PIKACHU",[CURIOUS] 
11,24,116,CONCIERGE,Those customers were successful in their battle and have just completed a free full-course meal! 
11,24,117,ASH,Yeah! 
11,24,118,MAY,When those doors opened I smelled the yummiest aroma ever! 
11,24,119,DAWN,"So, we'll just have to win and that's that! "
11,24,120,PIPLUP,[DETERMINED] 
11,24,121,JESSIE,Land of plenty. 
11,24,122,JAMES,I want an eating visa! 
11,24,123,MEOWTH,"Hey! Are you yelping yahoos forgetting that we're the bad guys which means we don't earn our munchies, we steal them? "
11,24,124,JESSIE,"Earth to Meowth, it's a free meal moron! "
11,24,125,JAMES,Free! One word self-respecting bad guys love! 
11,24,126,KYLIE,You must be our next customers then! 
11,24,127,ROMAN,Welcome to the Seven Stars Restaurant! My name is Roman and I'm a restaurateur who prides himself on the finest cuisine! 
11,24,128,KYLIE,"And, my name is Kylie! I've spared no expense in providing only the finest in décor and ambience. "
11,24,129,CONCIERGE,So shall we proceed two at a time with a Tag Battle then? 
11,24,130,ASH,Tag battle? Cool! 
11,24,131,DAWN,"May, can I be on your team? "
11,24,132,MAY,Sure! And then we can eat! 
11,24,133,BROCK,"I guess it's you and me, big guy. "
11,24,134,ASH,"It's been a while since we battled together, Brock, so let's do it! "
11,24,135,ROMAN,"All right, everyone please select your Pokémon! "
11,24,136,BROCK,"All right Sudowoodo, let's go! "
11,24,137,SUDOWOODO,[APPEARING] 
11,24,138,ASH,"Okay, Pikachu, get in there! "
11,24,139,PIKACHU,[EXCITED]

11,24,144,SNORLAX,[APPEARING] 
11,24,145,MUNCHLAX,[APPEARING]

11,24,147,DAWN,Evolution pairs are popular! 
11,24,148,POKEDEX,"Munchlax. The Big Eater Pokémon. It gobbles up its own body weight in food each day, and it swallows its food without almost any chewing. "
11,24,149,POKEDEX,"Snorlax. The Sleeping Pokémon, and the evolved form of Munchlax. It can eat four hundred pounds of food before feeling full. "
11,24,150,ROMAN,I would suggest in order to expedite our battle that we launch our moves at the same time! 
11,24,151,BROCK,"Ash, they sure sound confident. "
11,24,152,ASH,Yeah! 
11,24,153,ASH,Sounds like fun. We're in! 
11,24,154,TUXEDO MAN,I understand. So! Battle begin! 
11,24,155,ROMAN,"All right Snorlax, Mega Punch! "
11,24,156,ASH,"Pikachu, use Volt Tackle! "

11,24,169,"MUNCHLAX, SNORLAX",[DAZED] 
11,24,170,TUXEDO MAN,"So! Snorlax and Munchlax are unable to battle, and that means the customers win! "
11,24,171,ROMAN,What? 
11,24,172,KYLIE,No! Not my Munchlax! 
11,24,173,"SUDOWOODO, PIKACHU",[PLEASED] 
11,24,174,ASH,Just one hit? That was quick! 
11,24,175,BROCK,Guess they weren't as strong as we thought they were. 
11,24,176,MAY,"Now that's the Ash and Brock I remember! Hey, Dawn, let's finish our battle up with one hit too! "
11,24,177,DAWN,Right! 
11,24,178,ASH,"Dawn, May! Don't be too confident! "
11,24,179,DAWN,"Don't worry, we know! "
11,24,180,ROMAN,Of course the two winners may proceed into the restaurant and place their orders. 
11,24,181,ASH,Nah! It's all or none of us! 
11,24,182,PIKACHU,[AFFIRMATIVE]

11,24,199,ASH,"Man, has it been a long time! "
11,24,200,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
11,24,201,BROCK,Blaziken's stronger too! 
11,24,202,ROMAN,A Water and Fire type duo! The same rules apply all right? 
11,24,203,DAWN,That's fine with us! 
11,24,204,TUXEDO MAN,Very well! Battle... 
11,24,205,"KYLIE, ROMAN, CONCIERGE, BROCK, ASH, MAY",What the? 
11,24,206,WAITER,Roman! Somehow every single solitary piece of food from the kitchen's been stolen! 
11,24,207,ASH,Our food? 
11,24,208,DAWN,No way! 
11,24,209,MAY,I'll tell you nobody steals my food and gets away with it! 
11,24,210,DAWN,I think May's turned into a Fire type! 
11,24,211,PIPLUP,[AMAZED] 
11,24,212,BROCK,One thing that'll drive May over the edge is someone swiping her food! 
11,24,213,DAWN,What happened to our Princess? 
11,24,214,PIPLUP,[DISTRESSED] 
11,24,215,ASH,Whoa!

11,24,219,CHEF,I'm so sorry Mister Roman but our hors d'oeuvres and our soup and our main course and even our dessert is gone! Stolen right out from under my expertly trained eyes and nose! 
11,24,220,ROMAN,A travesty! How could this have happened? That food was for the gourmet enjoyment of our victorious customers! 
11,24,221,MAY,"Well, you've got that right! And I'm going to get our lunch back! "

11,24,239,DAWN,"Hey, Kylie, what's wrong with your Munchlax? "
11,24,240,KYLIE,I guess May's Munchlax's sense of smell is just better. 
11,24,241,BROCK,Or sense of stuffing its face.

11,23,134,RHONDA,"It's his day off, and because of that his whole staff refuses to tell me where Wallace is! But my sources tell me he's somewhere around here. "
11,23,135,RHONDA,"A sh*t of Wallace relaxing would be priceless, so needless to say we've just got to find him! Now if any of you see him you've got to let me know! "
11,23,136,RHONDA,Will you cut out this nonsense and get a grip already? We've got an exclusive to cover!

11,23,152,MEOWTH,Of course we know that Jessie won the Solaceon Contest because she was completely chilled cool and calm.

11,23,173,"ASH, BROCK, PIKACHU",[CONFUSED] 
11,23,174,MILOTIC,[SURPRISED] 
11,23,175,WALLACE,"Well well, hello there everyone! "
11,23,176,WALLACE,Ever since I arrived in Sinnoh my schedule just never seems to end! 
11,23,177,WALLACE,The talk shows... 
11,23,178,WALLACE,"Magazines, radio... "
11,23,179,WALLACE,"Even back at the hotel, the fans are all over me! "
11,23,180,WALLACE,And so I pleaded with my staff to give me just one day off and let me truly relax... 
11,23,181,WALLACE,And have some quality time with Milotic! 
11,23,182,"MILOTIC, PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[EXCITED] 
11,23,183,DAWN,They're sure having fun! 
11,23,184,WALLACE,Milotic hasn't looked this happy since we arrived in Sinnoh! 
11,23,185,WALLACE,My beautiful Milotic. 
11,23,186,MILOTIC,[HAPPY] 
11,23,187,DAWN,That's for sure. Beautiful's right! 
11,23,188,WALLACE,Why thank you! 
11,23,189,WALLACE,"The most important thing for Pokémon and Trainer is kinship, and should you ever forget about that your Pokémon will never shine! "
11,23,190,DAWN,You're so right! 
11,23,191,DAWN,I feel bad that we bothered you while you were taking a break. We won't let anyone know you're here! 
11,23,192,WALLACE,That's very nice! Thank you all. 
11,23,193,ASH,"Wait! Hey Wallace, Dawn's a Pokémon Coordinator too, and since she's gonna be entering the Wallace Cup you'll see her again for sure! "
11,23,194,WALLACE,Oh? Then I'm honored to have Dawn as one of our entrants! And if you wouldn't mind Dawn I would love for you to show me some of your Contest moves right now! 
11,23,195,DAWN,Right now? 
11,23,196,BROCK,That's great Dawn! What an opportunity! You can't pass up a chance to have a real Contest Master personally watch you work! 
11,23,197,ASH,He's right! Think of how ready you'll be for the Wallace Cup! 
11,23,198,DAWN,"I guess so, but... "
11,23,199,ASH,I've got it! You can battle me! 
11,23,200,DAWN,Battle you? 
11,23,201,ASH,"Of course, a Contest Battle! "
11,23,202,PIPLUP,[ENCOURAGING] 
11,23,203,DAWN,Right! 
11,23,204,DAWN,Thank you Wallace. 
11,23,205,PIPLUP,[DETERMINED] 
11,23,206,WALLACE,Why don't we go over here. 
11,23,207,"DAWN, ASH, BROCK",Sure! 
11,23,208,JAMES,The superstar's benevolent! 
11,23,209,JESSIE,And beautiful! Milotic too! 
11,23,210,MEOWTH,But get a load of the Twerps trying to get the upper hand! 
11,23,211,JESSIE,Are we jealous? Most unflattering. 
11,23,212,WOBBUFFET,[TEASING] 
11,23,213,DAWN,Oh dear. I don't think I've been this nervous in my life! 
11,23,214,PIPLUP,[DETERMINED] 
11,23,215,ASH,"Okay, Buizel, I choose you! "
11,23,216,BUIZEL,[APPEARING] 
11,23,217,BROCK,"Dawn was actually Buizel's trainer first. Wow, what a battler! Buizel is really something! "
11,23,218,WALLACE,So they made a trade then? 
11,23,219,BROCK,She got Ash's Aipom who loves competing in Contests! 
11,23,220,WALLACE,I see. 
11,23,221,DAWN,Piplup! You ready to go? 
11,23,222,PIPLUP,[DETERMINED] 
11,23,223,ASH,All right then bring it on! 
11,23,224,BUIZEL,[TAUNTING] 
11,23,225,DAWN,Okay Piplup use Bubble Beam! 
11,23,226,PIPLUP,[BUBBLE BEAM MOVE] 
11,23,227,ASH,Buizel! Sonic Boom! 
11,23,228,BUIZEL,[SONIC BOOM MOVE] 
11,23,229,ASH,Now use Water g*n! 
11,23,230,BUIZEL,[WATER g*n MOVE] 
11,23,231,DAWN,Piplup spin and dodge it! 
11,23,232,PIPLUP,[EXERTION] 
11,23,233,DAWN,"Great, now use Peck! "
11,23,234,PIPLUP,[PECK MOVE] 
11,23,235,BUIZEL,[EXERTION] 
11,23,236,PIPLUP,[EXERTION] 
11,23,237,ASH,Buizel! Aqua Jet! 
11,23,238,BUIZEL,[AQUA JET MOVE] 
11,23,239,WALLACE,That's excellent! The water brings out the best in Buizel! 
11,23,240,DAWN,"All right, Whirlpool! "
11,23,241,PIPLUP,[WHIRLPOOL MOVE] 
11,23,242,BUIZEL,[EXERTION] 
11,23,243,ASH,"Yeah, way to go Dawn! "
11,23,244,BUIZEL,[PLEASED] 
11,23,245,PIPLUP,[EXERTION] 
11,23,246,DAWN,"You too, Ash! "
11,23,247,PIPLUP,[PLEASED] 
11,23,248,WALLACE,"Wow, wonderful performance, Buizel and Piplup! "
11,23,249,WALLACE,Shall we end it there? 
11,23,250,ASH,"Yeah, sure! Thanks a lot Buizel! "
11,23,251,BUIZEL,[HAPPY] 
11,23,252,DAWN,"Great going, Piplup! "
11,23,253,PIPLUP,[HAPPY] 
11,23,254,WALLACE,"So Dawn, I hear it was you who raised Buizel! "
11,23,255,WALLACE,Since Buizel is so fond of battling it would be wonderful to see those impressive movements utilized in a Contest! Remember Buizel's unique battle style comes from the way you raised it! 
11,23,256,WALLACE,"So what would you think of entering the Wallace Cup with Buizel as your partner, Ash? "
11,23,257,ASH,Here's the thing... Both of us always get super pumped up and then we forget totally about the performance. 
11,23,258,BUIZEL,[SHEEPISH] 
11,23,259,DAWN,I'd love to see that! 
11,23,260,DAWN,"'Course, you know Buizel never got the chance to compete in a Contest when we were partners, and what Wallace said is true! "
11,23,261,DAWN,I know it would be great for Buizel! 
11,23,262,ASH,"You're right! Buizel, so what do you say? "
11,23,263,BUIZEL,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,23,264,BROCK,What did you think of Dawn and Piplup's performance? 
11,23,265,WALLACE,Let's see. 
11,23,266,WALLACE,"The way you show your moves is flawless, very well researched and rehearsed! But I heard some things about Piplup from Brock "
11,23,267,WALLACE,and I think you may indeed be focusing too much on the moves themselves! 
11,23,268,WALLACE,Think for a moment about Piplup's basic nature. 
11,23,269,WALLACE,"It can't be all about dramatic performance so I suggest keeping it more natural! Dawn, I was wondering have you played with your Pokémon lately? "
11,23,270,DAWN,Played with them? 
11,23,271,DAWN,"You're right, I've been concentrating too much on working and Contests! "
11,23,272,DAWN,"The truth is I've been thinking only about myself! I've been putting my needs over my Pokémon's needs the whole time! I guess we haven't been playing much at all, have we? "
11,23,273,PIPLUP,[HAPPY] 
11,23,274,JESSILINA,Aha! Trying to hide from the real Contest talent are we Wallace dear? 
11,23,275,JESSILINA,"Come come, it's not fair to not share your talents with those of us who really appreciate them! "
11,23,276,WALLACE,And you three would be? 
11,23,277,JESSILINA,Hello! I too am an idol with one ribbon under my designer belt! The lovely Jessilina! 
11,23,278,JESSILINA,Your fanniest of fans! 
11,23,279,JESSILINA,"And this magnificent Milotic must be the most precious Pokémon in the whole wide world, and here I am getting completely up close and personal with both of you! "
11,23,280,JESSILINA,Now watch this! Go Seviper! 
11,23,281,SEVIPER,[APPEARING] 
11,23,282,JESSILINA,A teensy tribute to you and your precious Pokémon partner in my inimitable star-struck style! 
11,23,283,WALLACE,"I'm flattered, but you might want to remove that before you compete. "
11,23,284,ASH,I'll say. 
11,23,285,PIKACHU,[UNIMPRESSED] 
11,23,286,JESSILINA,Of course! I'm entering the Wallace Cup too! 
11,23,287,JESSILINA,"So make sure you blow me kisses and chant Jessilina, Jessilina, Jessilina, Jessilina, Jessilina, Jessilina! "
11,23,288,JAMES,Can't you make a fool of yourself on your own time? 
11,23,289,MEOWTH,Yeah we get enough of your social graces at home! Back in 'da box lady! 
11,23,290,WALLACE,Milotic! Shall we demonstrate to these promising young Coordinators what a wonderful day of relaxation and play can do? 
11,23,291,MILOTIC,[AGREEING] 
11,23,292,DAWN,You mean you'd put on a performance for us? 
11,23,293,WALLACE,Sure! My way of thanking you for a wonderful time! 
11,23,294,MILOTIC,[EXCITED] 
11,23,295,WALLACE,Let's begin! Use Safeguard! 
11,23,296,MILOTIC,[SAFEGUARD MOVE]

11,23,301,ASH,Awesome! 
11,23,302,DAWN,It's almost mystical! 
11,23,303,BROCK,Now that's what it means to use a move that brings out your Pokémon's best! 
11,23,304,JESSILINA,I want one right now! 
11,23,305,WALLACE,Use Dragon Pulse! 
11,23,306,MILOTIC,[DRAGON PULSE MOVE]

11,23,315,MILOTIC,[SINGING] 
11,23,316,JESSILINA,How did you do that move? I want to use Aqua Ring! 
11,23,317,WALLACE,I'm terribly sorry but Seviper can't perform Aqua Ring! 
11,23,318,JESSILINA,But it's dressed up like Milotic! 
11,23,319,WALLACE,But it's still impossible! 
11,23,320,JESSILINA,Meanie pants! 
11,23,321,WALLACE,I'm looking forward to seeing you all at the Wallace Cup! Thanks for a nice time! 
11,23,322,"JESSILINA, JAMES, MEOWTH, SEVIPER, WOBBUFFET",[AMAZED] 
11,23,323,ASH,"Wow, where'd he go? "
11,23,324,BROCK,I'll tell you he's a real Contest Master. 
11,23,325,JESSILINA,With Wallace seated squarely in my cheering section I'm sure my next Contest win is as good as won! 
11,23,326,"ASH, BROCK, DAWN",Really? 
11,23,327,JESSILINA,Now don't tell me you're entering too. 
11,23,328,DAWN,I am. 
11,23,329,JESSALINE,Perhaps if your luck holds out you'll make it past the first stage this time! 
11,23,330,JESSILINA,Bye-bye! 
11,23,331,BROCK,"You'll be great Dawn, no doubt! "
11,23,332,ASH,No need to worry! 
11,23,333,PIKACHU,[ENCOURAGING] 
11,23,334,DAWN,Right! 
11,23,335,RHONDA,Wow! Did you get that? 
11,23,336,CAMERAMAN,Not a bit! Battery was dead. 
11,23,337,RHONDA,Nothing with Wallace and the girl? I've slaved my whole career for a poignant moment like this one and you have to ruin it with a dead battery! 
11,23,338,MARIAN,"Thanks to our special guest Wallace, the one and only! "
11,23,339,ASH,"Wow, and to think we hung out with him all day today! "
11,23,340,DAWN,"It's easy to say I'll put my Pokémon first, but not so easy to actually do! I really need to appreciate what's truly special about each of my Pokémon. I'll do my best! "
11,23,341,BROCK,Just relaxing's a good start. 
11,23,342,DAWN,"Yeah, that too. I hear you! "
11,23,343,ASH,Wallace did say playing with your Pokémon's really important. 
11,23,344,BROCK,Besides being fun it also helps with their appeal! 
11,23,345,NARRATOR,"Some wise and timely advice from a real Contest Master, as Dawn prepares to enter the Wallace Cup, named after none other than our Heroes' new friend, Contest Master Wallace! "
11,23,346,JOY,"Excuse me! Ash, a message asking for you to call the Pokémon Center in Snowpoint City has just come in! "
11,23,347,ASH,Where's Snowpoint City? 
11,23,348,JOY,It's right here! 
11,23,349,JOY,It's Sinnoh's farthest northern city!

11,22,45,SHO,"I want a full-power Evolution set, yo! "
11,22,46,DAWN,I've never heard of a Trainer who was working toward something like that. 
11,22,47,ASH,So why don't you get your Pichu to evolve and be done with it? 
11,22,48,SHO,"No way! Then I'd have to head on out and snatch another Pichu, dig? "
11,22,49,SHO,"Look, kid! If you don't wanna do business, then book! Take a hike! "

11,22,55,ASH,No way! 
11,22,56,SHO,'Sup with that? My guys would all testify I'm being straight up.

11,22,206,JESSIE,"Of course the resulting Raichu would be powerful beyond compare, but it somehow doesn't seem right! "
11,22,207,MEOWTH,Right? That sort of junk should be against the law!

11,17,45,BROCK,Come on! She gave you that badge because she recognized you and your Pokémons' strength and determination so you really ought to be proud! 
11,17,46,ASH,"Yeah, you're right. That means I've got to keep on battling super-hard, and prove what Maylene did was the right thing! So buddy, are you with me all the way? "

11,16,371,BROCK,Dawn! Look at that! 
11,16,372,LUCARIO,[SHOCKED] 
11,16,373,MAYLENE,Could we be seeing things? 
11,16,374,MAYLENE,or is that Water Pulse?

11,16,481,PIKACHU,[IMPRESSED] 
11,16,482,BUIZEL,[PLEASED] 
11,16,483,MAYLENE,Lucario you fought hard!

11,16,487,"AMBIPOM, PACHIRISU, BUNEARY, PIPLUP",[IMPRESSED] 
11,16,488,DAWN,And I got to see an awesome battle! 
11,16,489,DAWN,Since the battle ended up a tie what happens to the badge? 
11,16,490,CONNALLY,That decision depends on the judgment of the Gym Leader! 
11,16,491,MAYLENE,"So you're telling me if I give the word, Ash will get a badge? "
11,16,492,CONNALLY,Right! 
11,16,493,MAYLENE,Well then... 
11,16,494,MAYLENE,Let's just say Ash challenged me to the greatest Gym Battle I've ever had! 
11,16,495,MAYLENE,Is that good enough of a reason for you? 
11,16,496,"LUCARIO, MACHOKE, MEDITITE",[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,16,497,MAYLENE,They agree! 
11,16,498,MAYLENE,"Ash, please accept the Cobble Badge. "

11,16,500,MAYLENE,Of course! 
11,16,501,ASH,"Whoa, thanks Maylene! "
11,16,502,MAYLENE,I'm the one who should be thanking you! 
11,16,503,MAYLENE,"Thanks to you and your friends, I've got the confidence to continue as Gym Leader! "
11,16,504,DAWN,That's so great! 
11,16,505,BROCK,You make sure you stay strong! 
11,16,506,ASH,All right! 
11,16,507,ASH,Check it out! I just got the Cobble Badge! 
11,16,508,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
11,16,509,"CHIMCHAR, STARAVIA",[THRILLED] 
11,16,510,NARRATOR,A draw between Maylene and Ash has ended up a rousing win for both! 
11,16,511,NARRATOR,"Maylene's spirit burns brighter than ever, while Ash has earned the Cobble Badge! "
11,16,512,NARRATOR,"And, in the wake of our Hero's third Sinnoh League victory, Ash's spirit burns equally as bright"
11,15,0,NARRATOR,"Immediately upon their arrival in Veilstone City, our heroes came across Paul's older brother Reggie, a Pokémon Breeder, and then Maylene, the Veilstone City Gym Leader! But after her loss to Paul in a Gym battle, Maylene was considering quitting as Gym Leader, despite protests from Reggie and her Lucario! Then, sympathizing with Maylene's plight, Dawn suddenly surprised everybody by challenging Maylene to a Gym battle! "
11,15,1,DAWN,Now hold on! 
11,15,2,DAWN,"Excuse me, but I asked Maylene for a battle first! "
11,15,3,PIPLUP,[EMPHATIC] 
11,15,4,PIKACHU,[SURPRISED] 
11,15,5,MAYLENE,Hey Dawn? Mind if we have our battle tomorrow? I'll be at the Gym. 
11,15,6,MAYLENE,I just need a little time to get myself ready first! 
11,15,7,LUCARIO,[SKEPTICAL] 
11,15,8,DAWN,Of course! I don't mind at all! Tomorrow it is! 
11,15,9,PIPLUP,"[DETERMINED] On a road, far from home, you don't have to feel alone. Brave and strong, together we will be. It's our destiny! We will be heroes, We can change the world if we try! I go where you go, Forever friends, you and I! We will be heroes! Battle Dimension Pokémon! "
11,15,10,PIPLUP,[TRAINING] 
11,15,11,"PIPLUP, BUIZEL",[TRAINING] 
11,15,12,ASH,"Piplup's really getting into it, huh? "
11,15,13,DAWN,"Now Piplup, keep an eye on how Buizel moves! "
11,15,14,REGGIE,Hey Ash! 
11,15,15,REGGIE,Don't you think we should get started too? 
11,15,16,ASH,"Yeah, right there! Good luck with your battle Dawn! "
11,15,17,DAWN,Thanks! Good luck to you too! 
11,15,18,ASH,Thanks! 
11,15,19,BROCK,"Dawn, have you decided which Pokémon you're going to use? "
11,15,20,DAWN,"Well Maylene's using Fighting-type Pokémon, so I've decided to start with Piplup, since it can use a Flying-type move! "
11,15,21,DAWN,Next I'll take advantage of all that battle experience Ambipom got with Ash. 
11,15,22,DAWN,then Buneary with its awesome jumping skills! 
11,15,23,BROCK,Sounds good to me! 
11,15,24,ASH,Staravia up! 
11,15,25,STARAVIA,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,15,26,STARAVIA,[GREETING] 
11,15,27,REGGIE,Now watch closely. 
11,15,28,ASH,You've got it! 
11,15,29,REGGIE,"Staraptor, let's go, use Brave Bird! "
11,15,30,STARAPTOR,[BRAVE BIRD MOVE]

11,15,32,STARAPTOR,[IMPACT] 
11,15,33,"ASH, GLIGAR, STARAVIA",[SHOCK] 
11,15,34,STARAPTOR,[BATTLE CRY] 
11,15,35,ASH,"Man, what power! "
11,15,36,REGGIE,"Right, but you have to be careful because using power that strong takes its toll on Staraptor as well! "
11,15,37,REGGIE,Brave Bird tests the mettle of both Pokémon and Trainer! 
11,15,38,ASH,Then that means me! 
11,15,39,REGGIE,Are you scared Ash? 
11,15,40,ASH,No way! 
11,15,41,REGGIE,Good! Then let's give it a try! 
11,15,42,ASH,Right! 
11,15,43,ASH,"Okay, Staravia! Brave Bird now! "
11,15,44,STARAVIA,[BRAVE BIRD MOVE] 
11,15,45,STARAVIA,[RATTLED] 
11,15,46,STARAVIA,[GRUNT] 
11,15,47,ASH,Staravia! 
11,15,48,ASH,"Staravia, are you okay? "
11,15,49,GLIGAR,[CONCERNED] 
11,15,50,STARAVIA,[REASSURING] 
11,15,51,REGGIE,Looks like Staravia lost its balance right at the moment of power release. 
11,15,52,REGGIE,"Now maybe if we were to use a moving target instead of a rock, we could work on improving Staravia's concentration. "
11,15,53,REGGIE,But what moving target? 
11,15,54,ASH,"Hey, I'll be the target! "
11,15,55,REGGIE,"But that could be dangerous, Ash! "
11,15,56,ASH,"Anything to make Staravia stronger! Staravia, you ready? "
11,15,57,STARAVIA,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,15,58,STARAVIA,[READY] 
11,15,59,ASH,"All right, let's do it! "
11,15,60,STARAVIA,[BRAVE BIRD MOVE] 
11,15,61,STARAVIA,[DETERMINED] 
11,15,62,ASH,"Yeah, way to go Staravia! Just like that! "
11,15,63,STARAVIA,[BATTLE CRY] 
11,15,64,ASH,"Looking good, Staravia. One more time! "
11,15,65,DAWN,Ash sure is something! Let's show him what we can do! [ENTHUSIASTIC] 
11,15,66,STARAVIA,[BATTLE CRY] 
11,15,67,ASH,That power's starting to build up! One more time! 
11,15,68,ELECTABUZZ,[SHOCKED] 
11,15,69,ASH,Come on! 
11,15,70,STARAVIA,[BRAVE BIRD MOVE] 
11,15,71,BROCK,Pretty typical training for Ash! 
11,15,72,REGGIE,I kind of feel like I should stop him. 
11,15,73,REGGIE,He's just the opposite of my brother! 
11,15,74,REGGIE,"Hey, so what's the story with Dawn, Brock? "
11,15,75,BROCK,"Oh, she's ready to go all right! "
11,15,76,REGGIE,But why would a Coordinator fight a Gym Battle? 
11,15,77,REGGIE,She just doesn't seem like the type to do contests and battles! 
11,15,78,BROCK,I honestly think Dawn's going through all of this to help Maylene get her confidence back! 
11,15,79,BROCK,"Dawn knows Maylene's a little shaky right now, and she really wants her to rediscover her love for battling! "
11,15,80,LUCARIO,[FRUSTRATED] 
11,15,81,MAYLENE,"Come on, Lucario. Don't be angry! I know just how you feel! I'm going to take this challenge very seriously! "
11,15,82,CONNALLY,Yes! Exactly what we want to hear Master! 
11,15,83,MAYLENE,"Will you be my referee tomorrow, Connally? "
11,15,84,CONNALLY,"Yes, yes! "
11,15,85,"JAMES, SING SONGY",Seek and ye shall find. 
11,15,86,MEOWTH,Lucario! Let's grab it! 
11,15,87,"JESSIE, JAMES",Give me a break! 
11,15,88,JESSIE,One grab and Lucario will break you! 
11,15,89,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] -
11,15,90,MEOWTH,Yeah! -
11,15,91,JAMES,Touché. 
11,15,92,JAMES,This is a Gym Leader's Pokémon we're pursuing. 
11,15,93,JESSIE,"Since every time we try to poach primo Pokémon we fail miserably, I suggest Plan B! "
11,15,94,MEOWTH,And what might Plan B be? 
11,15,95,JESSIE,Simple! We grab a weaker Pokémon to train to our sneaky hearts' content! Then Plan B becomes Plan A! 
11,15,96,JAMES,It does? 
11,15,97,MEOWTH,"The last time I made a jump like that, I ended up falling off of a cliff! "
11,15,98,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,15,99,DAWN,Ash how's Staravia doing? 
11,15,100,ASH,Awesome! Even Reggie's amazed at how quick Staravia's getting it! 
11,15,101,ASH,How about you? 
11,15,102,DAWN,"We're doing great, thanks to Buizel and Pikachu, of course! "
11,15,103,PIKACHU,[FLATTERED] 
11,15,104,PIPLUP,[PLEASED] 
11,15,105,DAWN,"This is my first Gym Battle, and I have to admit that I've got a case of nerves! "
11,15,106,ASH,"Hey, every time I have a Gym Battle I start getting sweaty and my heart starts pounding, and it feels like there's a train going through my head! "
11,15,107,PIKACHU,[AGREEING] 
11,15,108,ASH,"Wow, you're really treating this like a real Gym Battle! "
11,15,109,DAWN,"You bet! Of course, now I understand exactly what you mean! "
11,15,110,ASH,I really hope it helps Maylene to get her confidence back soon! 
11,15,111,DAWN,Yeah! 
11,15,112,BROCK,I used to feel exactly the same wayback at the Pewter Gym. 
11,15,113,DAWN,That's right! I remember you used to be a Gym Leader! 
11,15,114,BROCK,A Gym Leader's biggest priority is to bring out the very best in their Pokémon! 
11,15,115,BROCK,"When I first started, I was worried about what I was doing, but after meeting lots of Trainers, I learned the most important thing of all. -"
11,15,116,ASH,And what's that? -
11,15,117,BROCK,"Truth is, great Gym Leaders are shaped by their challengers! "
11,15,118,BROCK,Through all of those Gym Battles. 
11,15,119,DAWN,Did you hear that? 
11,15,120,ASH,"Hey, I think I get it! So Dawn's battle could really help Maylene go up a level! "
11,15,121,BROCK,"That's it! By the way, Reggie said he'd be there tomorrow. It's going to be great! "
11,15,122,ASH,Yeah. Sure will! 
11,15,123,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
11,15,124,DAWN,Thanks! 
11,15,125,PIPLUP,[APPRECIATIVE] 
11,15,126,JAMES,Wired and ready! 
11,15,127,JAMES,I've got cameras cranking all over that jumping Gym! 
11,15,128,JAMES,Which means soon we'll have eyes peeled on every Pokémon in the place! 
11,15,129,MEOWTH,"Oh, come on! Not the Twerps! "
11,15,130,JESSIE,Don't those punks have enough Pokémon? 
11,15,131,WOBBUFFET,[EXASPERATED] 
11,15,132,JAMES,Twerps don't thieve! They're here to battle! 
11,15,133,DAWN,I challenge you! 
11,15,134,ASH,Awesome! You challenge a Gym with a big loud voice! 
11,15,135,JESSIE,What? A Twerpette challenge? 
11,15,136,JAMES,"Wow, what shifted her gears? "
11,15,137,MEOWTH,I thought she was a contest creature! 
11,15,138,MAYLENE,Sorry to keep you waiting. Welcome! 
11,15,139,DAWN,Thank you! And thanks for accepting my challenge! 
11,15,140,MAYLENE,I think we should be the ones thanking you! 
11,15,141,LUCARIO,[AGREEING] 
11,15,142,REGGIE,"Well, here we go! "
11,15,143,ASH,Yeah! 
11,15,144,CONNALLY,"So! The Gym Battle between Dawn, the challenger, and Maylene, the Gym Leader, is about to begin! "
11,15,145,CONNALLY,Each side will use three Pokémon and the challenge will be over when all three Pokémon on one side are unable to battle! 
11,15,146,CONNALLY,"Also, throughout this battle only the challenger will be allowed to substitute Pokémon! "
11,15,147,MAYLENE,"Now, let's begin! Go Meditite! "
11,15,148,MEDITITE,[APPEARING] 
11,15,149,DAWN,"Wow, Meditite's her first choice! "
11,15,150,POKEDEX,"Meditite. The Meditate Pokémon. Meditite uses meditation to increase its power, never skipping a single day of yoga training. "
11,15,151,BROCK,Alright! Dawn's battling a Psychic-type Pokémon! 
11,15,152,"ASH, REGGIE, BROCK, ASH",So now it's Dawn's turn! 
11,15,153,PIKACHU,[SURPRISED] 
11,15,154,ASH,Whoa. What's wrong with her? 
11,15,155,DAWN,"Wow, this is some pressure! A lot different than a contest. "
11,15,156,DAWN,Sitting on the sidelines is a lot different than standing down here! 
11,15,157,DAWN,I wonder if I'm ready for this. 
11,15,158,REGGIE,Uh oh. Looks like Dawn's getting nervous! 
11,15,159,ASH,Hey Dawn! Have fun out there! 
11,15,160,ASH,Maylene! Remember you're a Gym Leader -so show your strength! -
11,15,161,DAWN,Whoa. But Ash? 
11,15,162,MAYLENE,Oh my. Thanks very much Ash! Okay Dawn! Let's do this! Whenever you're ready! 
11,15,163,DAWN,"Right! This is gonna be fun! Buneary, let's go! "
11,15,164,BUNEARY,[APPEARING] 
11,15,165,BUNEARY,[CHANTING] 
11,15,166,PIKACHU,[CHEERING] 
11,15,167,BUNEARY,[CHANTING] 
11,15,168,DAWN,All right. Let's get this over with nice and quick! 
11,15,169,MAYLENE,Meditite! Let's make this an early day! 
11,15,170,MEDITITE,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,15,171,ASH,Ready for this Pikachu? 
11,15,172,PIKACHU,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,15,173,REGGIE,"Wow, Ash did the trick! "
11,15,174,BROCK,"Well I'm not surprised! Ash has a knack for instilling confidence, for sure! "
11,15,175,CONNALLY,So! The first att*ck goes to the challenger! 
11,15,176,CONNALLY,Now! Let the battle begin! 
11,15,177,DAWN,"Buneary, use Bounce! "
11,15,178,BUNEARY,[LAUNCHING] 
11,15,179,BUNEARY,[BOUNCE MOVE] 
11,15,180,BUNEARY,[BATTLE CRY] 
11,15,181,MAYLENE,Detect! 
11,15,182,MEDITITE,[DETECT MOVE] 
11,15,183,BUNEARY,[SURPRISED] 
11,15,184,ASH,It dodged! 
11,15,185,BUNEARY,[CRASHING] 
11,15,186,BROCK,It's called Detect because it detects and then avoids your opponent's move. 
11,15,187,ASH,She must've practiced it so she'd be ready to battle Flying-type Pokémon. 
11,15,188,MAYLENE,"All right, now it's my turn! Use Drain Punch! "
11,15,189,MEDITITE,[DRAIN PUNCH MOVE] 
11,15,190,ASH,Maylene and Meditite are moving in sync! 
11,15,191,REGGIE,"That's just the way Maylene does it. Since she's a warrior, she mirrors her Pokémon's moves, which makes herself stronger! "
11,15,192,REGGIE,She literally becomes one with her Pokémon! 
11,15,193,DAWN,Spin and dodge it! 
11,15,194,BUNEARY,[SPINNING] 
11,15,195,"ASH, DAWN, PIKACHU",[CONCERNED] 
11,15,196,BUNEARY,[PAINED] 
11,15,197,MEDITITE,[DETERMINED] 
11,15,198,BUNEARY,[CRASHING] 
11,15,199,DAWN,Buneary! You okay? 
11,15,200,BUNEARY,[EFFORT] 
11,15,201,ASH,"Even with that spin, they still got stuck! "
11,15,202,BROCK,If Drain Punch makes contact it can suck away a lot of power from your opponent. 
11,15,203,REGGIE,It's obvious that Maylene is much more accustomed to battling! 
11,15,204,REGGIE,If Maylene keeps this up... 
11,15,205,REGGIE,I'm afraid it's going to be a rough day for Dawn. 
11,15,206,JAMES,That Drain Punch Meditite managed packed a crunch of a punch! 
11,15,207,MEOWTH,So do you think that dynamo classifies as Plan B? 
11,15,208,JESSIE,"Perhaps, but I think we're better off with Plan C. "
11,15,209,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,15,210,DAWN,"Don't give up, Buneary! Ice Beam let's go! "
11,15,211,BUNEARY,[ICE BEAM MOVE]

11,15,213,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
11,15,214,DAWN,Okay. Now's our chance! 
11,15,215,BUNEARY,[DETERMINED] 
11,15,216,MAYLENE,"All right, Meditite. Confusion! "
11,15,217,MEDITITE,[CONFUSION MOVE] 
11,15,218,"BUNEARY, ASH, PIKACHU",[CONCERNED] 
11,15,219,DAWN,Dodge it! 
11,15,220,BUNEARY,[DODGING] 
11,15,221,MAYLENE,"Once again,Meditite. Confusion! "
11,15,222,MEDITITE,[CONFUSION MOVE] 
11,15,223,BUNEARY,[BEFUDDLED] 
11,15,224,DAWN,Oh no! Buneary! 
11,15,225,MAYLENE,All right! To the ground! 
11,15,226,MEDITITE,[COMMANDING] 
11,15,227,BUNEARY,[FEARFUL] -
11,15,228,ASH,No! - 
11,15,229,DAWN,Land then Bounce! 
11,15,230,BUNEARY,[LANDING] 
11,15,231,BUNEARY,[BOUNCE MOVE] -
11,15,232,ASH,"Wow, way to go! -"
11,15,233,PIKACHU,[IMPRESSED] 
11,15,234,DAWN,Now down! 
11,15,235,BUNEARY,[BATTLE CRY] 
11,15,236,MAYLENE,Drain Punch! Let's go! 
11,15,237,MEDITITE,[DRAIN PUNCH MOVE] 
11,15,238,"BUNEARY, MEDITITE",[IMPACT] 
11,15,239,"BUNEARY, MEDITITE",[EFFORT] 
11,15,240,BUNEARY,[LANDING] 
11,15,241,MEDITITE,[LANDING] 
11,15,242,ASH,Buneary's Bounce landed great! 
11,15,243,BROCK,But so did Meditite's Drain Punch! 
11,15,244,BUNEARY,[STRUGGLING] 
11,15,245,DAWN,Buneary! 
11,15,246,CONNALLY,So! Buneary is unable to battle! 
11,15,247,MAYLENE,Meditite that was excellent! 
11,15,248,MEDITITE,[SOLEMN] 
11,15,249,DAWN,"Thank you, Buneary. "
11,15,250,DAWN,"All of your hard work won't be wasted! Ambipom, you're next! "
11,15,251,AMBIPOM,[APPEARING] 
11,15,252,ASH,"Get them, Ambipom! "
11,15,253,AMBIPOM,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,15,254,DAWN,"Ambipom, Swift, let's go! "
11,15,255,AMBIPOM,[SWIFT MOVE] 
11,15,256,MEDITITE,[PAINED] 
11,15,257,ASH,"Well, all right! "
11,15,258,MAYLENE,Meditite! Drain Punch! 
11,15,259,MEDITITE,[DRAIN PUNCH MOVE] 
11,15,260,DAWN,"Block it, quick! "
11,15,261,AMBIPOM,[BLOCKING] 
11,15,262,MEDITITE,[SURPRISED] 
11,15,263,REGGIE,Wow! 
11,15,264,DAWN,"All right, Double Hit! "
11,15,265,AMBIPOM,[DOUBLE HIT MOVE] 
11,15,266,MEDITITE,[IMPACT] 
11,15,267,MEDITITE,[PAINED] 
11,15,268,AMBIPOM,[LANDING] 
11,15,269,CONNALLY,So! Meditite is unable to battle! 
11,15,270,DAWN,"Awesome! Ambipom, we did it! "
11,15,271,AMBIPOM,[EXCITED] 
11,15,272,MAYLENE,"Meditite, thanks for your effort! "
11,15,273,MAYLENE,Interesting. 
11,15,274,LUCARIO,[SURPRISED] 
11,15,275,MAYLENE,It seems you approach a battle like a contest! 
11,15,276,DAWN,I guess so! And I'm having a lot of fun doing it! 
11,15,277,MAYLENE,But our next go around won't be so easy! 
11,15,278,MAYLENE,"Lucario, you ready to go? "
11,15,279,LUCARIO,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,15,280,LUCARIO,[GROWLING] 
11,15,281,DAWN,Lucario looks ready! 
11,15,282,MAYLENE,"Lucario, don't be taken in by her contest-like moves! "
11,15,283,LUCARIO,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,15,284,ASH,There's something about Lucario that's different. 
11,15,285,REGGIE,The bond between those two is strong! 
11,15,286,REGGIE,Lucario must be sensing the confidence welling up inside Maylene! 
11,15,287,DAWN,"Let's go, Ambipom! Use Double Hit! "
11,15,288,AMBIPOM,[PREPARING] 
11,15,289,MAYLENE,Bone Rush!

11,15,299,MAYLENE,That was a great Bone Rush! 
11,15,300,LUCARIO,[INVIGORATED] 
11,15,301,LUCARIO,[CONFIDENT] 
11,15,302,ASH,That was amazing! 
11,15,303,PIKACHU,[IMPRESSED] 
11,15,304,BROCK,Every movement with a purpose! 
11,15,305,REGGIE,"Exactly! When Maylene and Lucario are working perfectly in sync, let's just say I defy anyone to find any kind of opening! "
11,15,306,REGGIE,It looks like Dawn has reawakened Maylene's passion for battling and ignited her team spirit! 
11,15,307,DAWN,She's a Gym Leader all right. Incredible strength! 
11,15,308,DAWN,"But, I'm not exactly a beginner either! "
11,15,309,DAWN,"Now, Piplup, you're up next! "
11,15,310,PIPLUP,[APPEARING] 
11,15,311,MAYLENE,"All right, give me everything you've got! "

11,15,321,DAWN,Piplup! 
11,15,322,PIPLUP,[DETERMINED] 
11,15,323,MAYLENE,It did nothing!

11,15,344,REGGIE,Maylene and Lucario are totally in sync 
11,15,345,REGGIE,and it has everything to do with Dawn's passionate battling style stirring things up!

11,15,358,ASH,"Whoa, what kind of move was that? "
11,15,359,PIKACHU,[SHOCKED] 
11,15,360,REGGIE,Force Palm. Force Palm's a Fighting-type move. 
11,15,361,REGGIE,"First, you get past your opponent's defense, and then hit them with massive energy focused in your palm! "
11,15,362,DAWN,She's some Gym Leader. What strength! 
11,15,363,JESSIE,Drat! Stuck on the horns of a dilemma! 
11,15,364,JAMES,Sounds like you're back to pursuing Plan A! 
11,15,365,JESSIE,No duh! Lucario's primo! 
11,15,366,MEOWTH,"Of course, if we try and poach that primo, we'll get a primo pounding! "
11,15,367,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,15,368,PIPLUP,[RALLYING] 
11,15,369,DAWN,All right Piplup! That's the way it's done!

11,15,371,MAYLENE,"You're right, Lucario! "
11,15,372,MAYLENE,How much fun is this battle? 
11,15,373,MAYLENE,It's been awhile since I felt so good! 
11,15,374,REGGIE,Wonder if this Maylene would've been beaten by Paul? 
11,15,375,MAYLENE,Now Lucario! Use Aura Sphere! 
11,15,376,LUCARIO,[AURA SPHERE MOVE]

11,15,382,MAYLENE,You okay? 
11,15,383,LUCARIO,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,15,384,DAWN,"Since Peck is a Flying-type move, it's a good match against the Fighting-type Aura Sphere! "
11,15,385,DAWN,"Of course that means, we can still win this thing! "
11,15,386,LUCARIO,[INSPIRED] 
11,15,387,MAYLENE,"All right, let's do that! "
11,15,388,MAYLENE,We'll break down their combinations! 
11,15,389,MAYLENE,"Now Aura Sphere, once more! "
11,15,390,DAWN,"Piplup, use Bubble Beam! "

11,15,400,PIPLUP,[GROAN] 
11,15,401,CONNALLY,"So, Piplup is unable to battle! "
11,15,402,CONNALLY,"Which means, the winner of this battle is the Gym Leader, Maylene! "
11,15,403,DAWN,Piplup! 
11,15,404,ASH,I guess that's it. 
11,15,405,PIKACHU,[DISAPPOINTED]

11,15,414,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
11,15,415,JAMES,Gobs of grunt work and we already knew Lucario was tops! 
11,15,416,JESSIE,All those cameras and not a trace of alternate Pokémon in sight! 
11,15,417,MEOWTH,"You know folks, technology's groovy but what do you say we use our feet to check out the scene? "
11,15,418,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",Keen! 
11,15,419,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,15,420,MAYLENE,I don't know how to thank you Dawn. 
11,15,421,MAYLENE,I forgot all about my fears and about winning or losing! All I could think about was how much fun it was. 
11,15,422,MAYLENE,"Wow, it sure felt like old times. "
11,15,423,LUCARIO,[AGREEING] 
11,15,424,DAWN,"That really means so much to me! Hey, and I'll bet you'll have at least as much fun when you have a battle with Ash! "
11,15,425,MAYLENE,That's right. I guess I forgot 
11,15,426,DAWN,A battle between you two will be a real Gym Battle! 
11,15,427,MAYLENE,"Okay, I'm starting to get the whole picture now! "
11,15,428,MAYLENE,And I realize I've got to stay on as Gym Leader. Especially after you reminded me of just how much fun a great battle can be! 
11,15,429,ASH,"That's the spirit, Maylene! "
11,15,430,PIKACHU,[PRAISING] 
11,15,431,LUCARIO,[SOLEMN] 
11,15,432,BROCK,Your strategy really paid off! 
11,15,433,DAWN,"Yeah! And soon Piplup, we'll both be up in the bleachers cheering for Ash, right? "
11,15,434,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
11,15,435,REGGIE,I can guarantee you'll have a great timeup against Ash's battling style! 
11,15,436,MAYLENE,If that's the case I've got another fun battle to look forward to! 
11,15,437,ASH,"Great! And once my Staravia perfects that new move, you can be sure I'll be right back here to challenge you! "
11,15,438,PIKACHU,[CONFIDENT] 
11,15,439,MAYLENE,Good!

11,15,441,NARRATOR,"Thanks to Dawn, the fiery spirit of a Gym Leader has once again been ignited within Maylene's soul! "

11,14,21,BROCK,It's a mysterious power some say everyone has. But I've heard it's stronger in some people than in others! 
11,14,22,MAYLENE,"Uh oh. Lucario, you're angry at me, aren't you? "
11,14,23,MAYLENE,Are you using Bone Rush?!

11,14,77,REGGIE,That must mean you know Paul.

11,14,79,PIKACHU,[SURPRISED] 
11,14,80,REGGIE,That's why Electabuzz was giving you grief! 
11,14,81,ASH,What? 
11,14,82,REGGIE,I'm Reggie! My brother you know! 
11,14,83,ASH,You're Paul's older brother? 
11,14,84,REGGIE,"And that Electabuzz belongs to Paul alright. You see, since I'm a Breeder, Paul decided to leave all of his Pokémon here with me for a little training! "
11,14,85,PIKACHU,[CURIOUS] 
11,14,86,ASH,"Well my name is Ash, and I came here to challenge the Veilstone Gym! So has Paul had a battle over there yet? "
11,14,87,REGGIE,"Yeah, he won! He defeated her. "
11,14,88,LUCARIO,[EMBARRASSED] 
11,14,89,ASH,Whoa! She's the Gym Leader? 
11,14,90,REGGIE,"Right, so why don't you saw hello to Maylene, the Veilstone Gym Leader! "
11,14,91,ASH,Awesome! 
11,14,92,ASH,Wow and you've even got a Lucario. Can we have a Gym Battle soon? 
11,14,93,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
11,14,94,MAYLENE,Sorry! But would you mind going to some other gym instead? 
11,14,95,LUCARIO,[FOCUSED] 
11,14,96,REGGIE,"You see, Lucario's been pushing Maylene really hard like this all day long. "
11,14,97,REGGIE,Lucario's not happy with Maylene as a battle partner yet. 
11,14,98,DAWN,What about all those Aura Spheres we saw? 
11,14,99,BROCK,"That must've been Lucario, training the Trainer! "
11,14,100,ASH,Training the Trainer? 
11,14,101,JAMES,So Lucario rules. 
11,14,102,JESSIE,While that Gym Leader drools! 
11,14,103,MEOWTH,Now if we could draft that dynamo then we'd stop drooling and some of that ruling might just rub off on us!

11,14,106,MAYLENE,I told you to stop!

11,14,108,CONNALLY,"Well, I thought I might find you out here Maylene! "
11,14,109,MAYLENE,I'm not going back to the Gym! 
11,14,110,CONNALLY,Stop! A Gym leader does not act in this manner in front of other Trainers! 
11,14,111,REGGIE,"Those Black Belts are students of the Veilstone Gym. Actually Maylene is well-respected as a battler! But she became the Gym Leader just six months ago, and they're trying to toughen her up... "
11,14,112,MAYLENE,Please understand! I don't want to be Gym Leader anymore! 
11,14,113,LUCARIO,[SHOCKED] / [AURA SPHERE MOVE] 
11,14,114,LUCARIO,[IMPRESSED] 
11,14,115,REGGIE,Is it because of Paul? 
11,14,116,REGGIE,Veilstone Gym is a Fighting-type Gym. 
11,14,117,REGGIE,"Paul came here using Flying-type Pokémon, which is a smart strategy! "
11,14,118,REGGIE,"His Murkrow had evolved evolved into a Honchcrow, and he polished off Maylene's first and second Pokémon in no time flat. "
11,14,119,REGGIE,"Then, when he battled against Lucario, he cleverly used Magmar, which of course is a Fire type! "
11,14,120,MAYLENE,I was totally out of synch with Lucario and all my Pokémon! 
11,14,121,MAYLENE,It didn't even look like a battle with a Gym Leader! I can hardly blame the challenger for what he said to me. 
11,14,122,ASH,What did Paul say? 
11,14,123,MAYLENE,"""You're the weakest..."" "
11,14,124,PAUL,"...the weakest leader I ever fought, and this lightweight badge is just like you! "
11,14,125,REGGIE,"I'm sorry, but Paul's always had a bit of a cruel streak in him! "
11,14,126,MAYLENE,"But the thing is, he was completely right! I do appreciate everything Lucario's been trying do for me. I'm sorry! ASH, BROCK, DAWN, REGGIE, CONNAL [SURPRISED] "
11,14,127,LUCARIO,[CONCERNED] 
11,14,128,MAYLENE,Just stay away! 
11,14,129,LUCARIO,[SAD] 
11,14,130,CONNALLY,Master Maylene. 
11,14,131,REGGIE,"Connally, I'd like you to let Lucario and me handle this. "
11,14,132,CONNALLY,"All right, if that's what you wish Master Reggie! "
11,14,133,REGGIE,I'm sorry. You traveled a long way. 
11,14,134,ASH,"It's okay! It would've been awesome to battle Lucario, though. "
11,14,135,BROCK,Come on. Let's find another Gym. 
11,14,136,LUCARIO,[FRUSTRATED] 
11,14,137,DAWN,"Hold on, Ash! Wait! "
11,14,138,"ASH, BROCK, REGGIE, BLACK BELTS, PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[SURPRISED] 
11,14,139,DAWN,I have to say something! Reggie may I go have a talk with Maylene? 
11,14,140,REGGIE,Uh. I guess that wouldn't be a problem. 
11,14,141,DAWN,Lucario do you know where Maylene was headed? 
11,14,142,LUCARIO,[ENTHUSED] / [URGENT] 
11,14,143,DAWN,"Piplup, I want you to come too! "
11,14,144,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
11,14,145,ASH,Wow. Wonder what she could be up to. 
11,14,146,MAYLENE,"Please, please Lucario, let me be... "
11,14,147,MAYLENE,What do you want? 
11,14,148,REGGIE,Maylene and Lucario were a famous battling team in Veilstone City. 
11,14,149,REGGIE,"It was big news when Maylene became the Veilstone Gym Leader. But, as you saw, she's begun to have a few doubts about herself! "
11,14,150,ASH,Yeah. 
11,14,151,BROCK,Everyone has doubts in the beginning. Especially Gym Leaders who have to learn how to win a battle under intense pressure! 
11,14,152,ASH,"Yeah Brock, you'd know all right! "
11,14,153,DAWN,I didn't get past round one for two contests in a row. I know how you feel! I'm taking a break. 
11,14,154,DAWN,"I tell everyone I'm just recharging my batteries, but to be totally honest, sometimes I think I'm not cut out for contests! "
11,14,155,MAYLENE,I relate! 
11,14,156,MAYLENE,"To tell the truth, every time I start to consider that winning or losing a Gym battle could change a challenger's whole life, it kind of scares me! "
11,14,157,MAYLENE,I just can't concentrate the way I used to. 
11,14,158,LUCARIO,[UPSET] 
11,14,159,MAYLENE,Please don't be angry! 
11,14,160,DAWN,Yeah come on Lucario. Listen to what she has to say! 
11,14,161,PIPLUP,[ENCOURAGING] 
11,14,162,MAYLENE,"I just can't be a Gym Leader feeling like this, especially after what Reggie's younger brother said to me. "
11,14,163,DAWN,That's just the kind of guy Paul is. Don't let it bother you! 
11,14,164,MAYLENE,"It used to be fun whether I won, or lost... Yeah, I know. I only lost twice and now I'm just not sure what to do anymore. "
11,14,165,DAWN,Sometimes I feel like my contests are just holding Ash back from his dreams! 
11,14,166,MAYLENE,And sometimes I feel like I'm just causing trouble for Lucario and my students. 
11,14,167,JESSIE,Relax! Your troubles are history!

11,14,190,MAYLENE,What do you mean after Lucario?! 
11,14,191,JESSIE,"To be up front and frank, we're here to offer lucky Lucario a better deal! "
11,14,192,DAWN,What deal? 
11,14,193,JAMES,A winning warrior like Lucario deserves to side with someone stronger than this Gym Leader loser! 
11,14,194,MEOWTH,"And that someone is us! With you on board, we'll rule the world! "
11,14,195,REGGIE,I remember this little Chimchar! How are you? 
11,14,196,CHIMCHAR,[HAPPY] 
11,14,197,REGGIE,"So Ash, I'm sure Paul must have really put you through the mill with all of those intense battling strategies he always comes up with! "
11,14,198,ASH,I don't care about any of that! The most important thing to winning a battle is to be one with your Pokémon! I'll b*at that guy! 
11,14,199,REGGIE,I'd like to see that! A battle between you two! 
11,14,200,JESSIE,Make up your mind! Stay with that sad sack or tag along with us! 
11,14,201,MEOWTH,Act now and this balloon can be your ride! 
11,14,202,JAMES,Not to mention access to my bottle caps!

11,14,204,LUCARIO,[FOCUSED] 
11,14,205,JESSIE,What a unique way of telling us it's a deal! 
11,14,206,JAMES,Yay! That's some steal! 
11,14,207,LUCARIO,[BONE RUSH MOVE] 
11,14,208,JESSIE,Maybe it was allergic to chocolate! 
11,14,209,JAMES,It can't be allergic to bottle caps! 
11,14,210,MEOWTH,I think it was allergic to you! 
11,14,211,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",We're blasting off again! 
11,14,212,LUCARIO,[SATISFIED] 
11,14,213,MAYLENE,Wow. Thank you! I'll bet you're still mad at me though. 
11,14,214,DAWN,"If Lucario's angry, it's only because it really cares about you and wants you to battle with him. Don't you see? "
11,14,215,MAYLENE,Really? 
11,14,216,DAWN,Hey I know! Let's you and I have a battle! 
11,14,217,LUCARIO,[CONFUSED]

11,14,225,REGGIE,"I know it's no substitute for the Veilstone Gym, but I'd really like to see how Paul's rival stacks up! "
11,14,226,ASH,Awesome! It's a deal!

11,14,228,CHIMCHAR,[EXCITED] 
11,14,229,ASH,Let's do it using the same three-on-three rules I used with Paul which means two wins takes it! 
11,14,230,REGGIE,Okay! Sounds great! 
11,14,231,ASH,All right! We'll be waiting for you outside! 
11,14,232,"PIKACHU, CHIMCHAR",[EXCITED]

11,12,87,JAMES,"Consistently full stomachs translate directly into greater thieving creativity and thus productivity, too! And that means... "
11,12,88,"JAMES, JESSIE, MEOWTH","When breakfast is served, and luncheon is served, and dinner is served, we're gonna be rich! "
11,12,89,WOBBUFFET,[AGREEING]

11,12,93,"METAPOD, BUTTERFREE, BEAUTIFLY, WURMPLE",[RELAXING] 
11,12,94,OFFICER JENNY,The Gliscor and Gligar have turned our city into a ghost town! 
11,12,95,OFFICER JENNY,"They've eaten up every bit of fruit and vegetables they could find, and now they're grabbing food right out of our hands! "
11,12,96,BROCK,"But, Gliscor and Gligar usually live in the forest don't they? What are they doing here? "
11,12,97,OFFICER JENNY,We think they've all managed to get lost. 
11,12,98,ASH,That is so weird! 
11,12,99,PIKACHU,[CURIOUS] 
11,12,100,NURSE JOY,But true! We had a storm one day... 
11,12,101,NURSE JOY,and the wind was particularly fierce! 
11,12,102,NURSE JOY,"It was so strong that Gliscor was unable to escape its force, so it ended up being trapped in our city! "
11,12,103,NURSE JOY,Of course Gliscor wanted to return to the forest. 
11,12,104,NURSE JOY,But the winds were just too strong! 
11,12,105,NURSE JOY,They still are. 
11,12,106,BROCK,Of course! Those skyscraper currents are strong too strong to fight! 
11,12,107,NURSE JOY,"Yes, they are! "
11,12,108,DAWN,Skyscraper currents? 
11,12,109,BROCK,"The taller a building is, the stronger the winds that swirl around it! "
11,12,110,OFFICER JENNY,"So, Gliscor had no other choice but to stay here and before long it had attracted all the Gligar in the surrounding area! "
11,12,111,ASH,"But, how'd it do that? "
11,12,112,DAWN,That's amazing! 
11,12,113,NURSE JOY,"Gliscor and Gligar fire off a kind of soundwave in order to detect obstacles, and fly around them. "
11,12,114,NURSE JOY,"But in the city these sound waves can become magnified and scattered, bouncing wildly off of buildings. "
11,12,115,NURSE JOY,These powerful sound waves are what attracted the Gligar attracting them to the city! 
11,12,116,GLIGAR GROUP,[FOCUSED] 
11,12,117,NURSE JOY,We've tried many times to capture them so we could return them to the forest. But they're very cautious and we can't get a hold of them! 
11,12,118,OFFICER JENNY,"So, our latest plan is to lure them all in using the Gligars' favorite fruit as bait! "
11,12,119,ASH,I wanna help too!

11,11,10,ASH,"We'll work later, don't worry! Don't you feel tired? "

11,11,14,PIPLUP,[AGREEING] 
11,11,15,ASH,"Okay, Brock! I'm so ready for a nice hot bath at the next Pokémon Center, and then a good night's sleep! "
11,11,16,BROCK,"Problem is, there isn't a Pokémon Center in the next town that I see. "
11,11,17,ASH,What? 
11,11,18,DAWN,"So, why don't we all go to a hot spring? I know there's one nearby where they allow Pokémon in too! "
11,11,19,ASH,Cool! 
11,11,20,BROCK,How do you know there's a hot spring near here? 
11,11,21,DAWN,Easy! One of my best friends happens to live at a hot spring hotel! 
11,11,22,BROCK,Talk about good luck! 
11,11,23,ASH,Great! All right! Hot spring here we come!

11,11,32,LEONA,Thank you! That's exactly -what I wanted to hear! -
11,11,33,DAWN,Leona? 
11,11,34,LEONA,[SURPRISED] 
11,11,35,LEONA,Dee Dee! 
11,11,36,DAWN,Please! I've had just about enough of that name! 
11,11,37,LEONA,"Okay, I give! "
11,11,38,LEONA,It's been such a long time! It's great to see you! 
11,11,39,DAWN,It's great to see you too! How's the hot spring hotel biz? 
11,11,40,LEONA,Uh. To tell you the truth things have been a little bit slow lately. I saw you on T.V. competing in one of your Contests the other day! 
11,11,41,DAWN,Oh. 
11,11,42,LEONA,"Sorry you lost in the first round, but no need to worry! You'll win the next Contest! And when that happens, I promise we'll all be there to cheer you on to victory! "
11,11,43,DAWN,"I'm afraid my next Contest isn't going to be for a while. See, I'm taking a little break! "
11,11,44,LEONA,Really? That's a surprise. 
11,11,45,DAWN,"So, there's no better way to take a break than to chill out in the hot spring at your hotel! And you know our Pokémon have got to be feeling the same way too! "
11,11,46,LEONA,"Uh. Well, I guess it's okay. "
11,11,47,ASH,"Dawn, will you introduce us to your buddy already? "
11,11,48,DAWN,"Hey, sorry guys! I want you all to meet Leona, my best friend since we met way back in Kindergarten! Say hello to my friends Ash and Brock! "
11,11,49,LEONA,Well hello! You've all caught me working hard at being a Pokémon Trainer! 
11,11,50,ASH,Awesome that's just what I'm doing! Hey I know! Let's have a battle! 
11,11,51,LEONA,"A battle sounds great! Thing is, I really don't have time for that right now. "
11,11,52,ASH,You don't? 
11,11,53,DAWN,Come on! Let's go jump in that hot spring! 
11,11,54,LEONA,"But, the thing is... "
11,11,55,DAWN,"Thanks, Leona! We're going to go now okay? "
11,11,56,LEONA,But it's not ready. 
11,11,57,DAWN,"Ah, no need to worry. I'm sure I can find it all by myself! Hey guys, let's GO! "
11,11,58,LEONA,Wait! 
11,11,59,LEONA,"But, Dawn! "
11,11,60,DAWN,"The healing waters in this hot spring are supposed to be good for anything and everything that's ailing you, no matter what! "
11,11,61,ASH,I'm in first! 
11,11,62,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
11,11,63,PIPLUP,[SHOCKED] [CONFUSED] 
11,11,64,DAWN,This is it? 
11,11,65,BROCK,It's shallow! 
11,11,66,ASH,And cold! 
11,11,67,LEONA,I tried to warn you! 
11,11,68,LEONA,I'm so sorry! The hot spring's not flowing right now! 
11,11,69,LEONA,I guess you can tell how embarrassed I am right? 
11,11,70,DAWN,What's wrong with the hot spring? 
11,11,71,LEONA,Last week out of no where the water just stopped flowing! 
11,11,72,LEONA,"The source of the hot spring is located up at the top of that mountain. The water flows down through a huge pipe running down the mountainside, and when it stopped Mama and Papa went up to investigate! "
11,11,73,DAWN,I see! That explains why you're here alone. 
11,11,74,LEONA,"Right. I really wish you could all check out for yourselves how relaxed and refreshed our hot spring can make you feel! But, at this rate, if things don't change for the better, we'll just have to close up the hotel for good. "
11,11,75,DAWN,"Wow. I was so looking forward to a little R and R. Well, what can you do? "
11,11,76,LEONA,Hey! No need to worry! 
11,11,77,BROCK,There's no doubt those two grew up together. 
11,11,78,ASH,Like two peas in a pod! 
11,11,79,DAWN,But that's when I worry the most! 
11,11,80,LEONA,"Dawn, I'm serious! My Swinub are on the case! They promised to find another hot spring to tap into! "
11,11,81,DAWN,Those are Swinub? 
11,11,82,POKEDEX,"Swinub. The Pig Pokémon. Swinub love mushrooms that grow under the dead grass, searching for them by smell and often discovering hot springs in the process. "
11,11,83,ASH,"Oh, I get it! That means your Swinub really can find hot springs! "
11,11,84,LEONA,"Right! On top of that, I've even taught my three Swinub how to use Dig too! "
11,11,85,DAWN,Awesome! Just what I'd expect from you! That reminds me... 
11,11,86,CHILD LEONA,"Poor Dawn, is that big bully still picking on you? "
11,11,87,CHILD DAWN,Yeah... 
11,11,88,SCHOOL BULLY,Stay away! 
11,11,89,SCHOOL BULLY,"It's my castle, see? "
11,11,90,CHILD LEONA,"Hey, no need to worry! -"
11,11,91,CHILD DAWN,Really? -
11,11,92,CHILD LEONA,Sure! You may not be able to stop that boy alone but if we do it together we can't lose! 
11,11,93,DAWN,"What we need to do is work as a team! That way, we'll find a hot spring before you know it! "
11,11,94,ASH,Sounds good! I want to help too! 
11,11,95,BROCK,Yeah me too!

11,11,102,SWINUB TRIO,[EXCITED] 
11,11,103,LEONA,They've picked up the scent of a hot spring! 
11,11,104,ASH,"What do you know! Man, that was easy! "
11,11,105,AWN,Yeah! 
11,11,106,MEOWTH,"Dig it, if we want to turn into spa big sh*ts we'd better start digging it! "
11,11,107,JAMES,"No doubt, digging well spent! A spa in these stress-filled times can bring big bucks! "
11,11,108,JESSIE,"And big promotions! First off, a gift for our dear boss: A membership card for life! "
11,11,109,MEOWTH,And what a life that'll be! 
11,11,110,MEOWTH,"Days of hot-spring sitting, chilling out big-time from the stress! "
11,11,111,MEOWTH,"And when you add in a deep-heated back massage to the first-class entertainment, they'll be only one thing he'll be able to say! "
11,11,112,MEOWTH,"""In gratitude for my pain-free membership to your wonderful spa, you're in charge of the whole Sinnoh region!"" "

11,11,117,SWINUB TRIO,[EXCITED] 
11,11,118,DAWN,I see steam! 
11,11,119,LEONA,I can smell that hot spring too! 
11,11,120,"LEONA, DAWN",And it smells great! 
11,11,121,"LEONA, DAWN",What? 
11,11,122,LEONA,They're building a new hotel? 
11,11,123,ASH,The hot spring's already been dug out! 
11,11,124,BROCK,I guess we're a little too late. 
11,11,125,JESSIE,Twerps! They're like a cold that won't go away! 
11,11,126,MEOWTH,"Hey, don't worry Doctor Meowth's got the cure! "
11,11,127,JAMES,I'm not sick! 
11,11,128,MEOWTH,Just watch this! 
11,11,129,MEOWTH,"All right kiddies, this ain't no sandbox, we've got work to do! Move your juvenile keisters to another spot! "
11,11,130,LEONA,Excuse me! That's my hot spring hotel down the mountain! Are you saying this hot spring construction belongs to you three? 
11,11,131,MEOWTH,Yipes! 
11,11,132,JESSIE,You are perceptive! 
11,11,133,JAMES,And I'll have you know we've worked hard to spring this spring! 
11,11,134,MEOWTH,"Yeah, what he said! See we've been doing more digging than a bunch of music lovers at a rock concert!! "
11,11,135,MEOWTH,Oofah! Moving the earth for all it's worth. 
11,11,136,MEOWTH,"When all of a sudden, whamo! We hit a treasure box filled with beautiful booty! "
11,11,137,JESSIE,We can't waste our precious time fiddling with priceless pearls when there's a hot spring to uncork! 
11,11,138,JAMES,"When you're right, you're right! Though, that's not often. Anyway, with strength of determination let's make our hot spring hotel ownership a reality! "
11,11,139,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH","Dig, dig dig dig "
11,11,140,JAMES,Hark! A gaggle of gurgling! 
11,11,141,MEOWTH,Double hark! A mighty flow down below

11,11,146,LEONA,Hold on! 
11,11,147,DAWN,"What, Leona? Something wrong? "
11,11,148,LEONA,I know our hot spring water like the back of my hand. 
11,11,149,LEONA,The way it smells and looks and this water's the same! 
11,11,150,LEONA,I knew it! It feels the same too! 
11,11,151,SWINUB TRIO,[AGREEING] 
11,11,152,DAWN,Obviously your Swinub agree! 
11,11,153,LEONA,I'll tell you what I think! I think you tapped into our pipe without permission! 
11,11,154,MEOWTH,I think she tapped the truth! 
11,11,155,JAMES,Will you put a cork in it? 
11,11,156,JESSIE,"So! Taste, touch and feel are fine, but let's see you produce some positive proof! "
11,11,157,LEONA,What do you mean? 
11,11,158,JESSIE,What I said! Show me where your hotel's name is printed on the water! Proof of liquid ownership! 
11,11,159,JESSIE,"Then, and only then will I lend an ear to your ridiculous ranting! "
11,11,160,LEONA,How do I do that? 
11,11,161,BROCK,"Well I guess if you have water coming from a different source on the same mountain, it would still smell and feel pretty similar. "
11,11,162,JESSIE,One of you gets it right! You're lucky your baseless accusations don't land you in juvenile court! You've got some nerdy nerve!

11,11,179,LEONA,I'll bet the same thing you are! 
11,11,180,MAMA,Your dad and I were right in the middle of giving the pipe a good once-over to see if there was a leak somewhere. 
11,11,181,PAPA,There's a leak all right! 
11,11,182,PAPA,We discovered another pipe attached directly to our main water line! 
11,11,183,PAPA,Someone was siphoning the water right from under our noses! 
11,11,184,MAMA,So we attached a transmitter to our Wooper and had it go directly into the pipe. 
11,11,185,LEONA,And if the Wooper came out in this hot spring we'd know what that means! 
11,11,186,LEONA,You liars! This really is our hot spring and you know it! 
11,11,187,JESSIE,Looks like this court sides with the Twerps!

11,10,74,AUTUMN,"That's not it! The truth is Ilta is one selfish Miltank! And she's not even that cute, so I'm just starting to think I'll just let her go! "
11,10,75,BROCK,That's wrong! 
11,10,76,BROCK,You can't do that! Giving up on your Miltank without first taking enough time to get to know her and understand her is no good for either of you!

11,09,90,"BROCK, ASH, PIKACHU",[IMPRESSED] 
11,09,91,KENNY,Yeah Breloom! Way to go! 
11,09,92,CONTESTA,Utilizing Stun Spore and Mach Punch in tandem to show off Breloom's beauty and power was quite a brilliant and well-thought-out strategy! 
11,09,93,SUKIZO,"Yes. Remarkable, too! "
11,09,94,NURSE JOY,It's quite easy to see from that polished and fluid performance how well Breloom's been raised! 
11,09,95,DAWN,"What an awesome job! I've got to admit, Kenny's really improved. "
11,09,96,DAWN,But I can't give up. I've worked too hard. 
11,09,97,PIPLUP,[PENSIVE] 
11,09,98,ASH,"You're worried about Dawn, aren't you, Piplup? "
11,09,99,PIPLUP,[WORRIED] 
11,09,100,BROCK,"Sure, Piplup can see as well as any of us how much better Kenny's gotten. "
11,09,101,ASH,"No need to worry, Piplup! You gotta believe in Dawn! "
11,09,102,PIKACHU,[CHEERFUL] 
11,09,103,PIPLUP,[HAPPY]

11,09,113,JESSIE,I know it's a thrill for you to see me. 
11,09,114,JESSIE,Now Dustox! Let's get this party started! 
11,09,115,DUSTOX,[APPEARING] 
11,09,116,DUSTOX,[SHOWING OFF] 
11,09,117,MARIAN,And Dustox spreads its shiny wings to show off those sparkling scales! 
11,09,118,JAMES,Oooh! Shine on. 
11,09,119,MEOWTH,Feeling tough and looking buff! 
11,09,120,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,09,121,JESSIE,"All right, pay close attention Pokémon people, and you just might learn something! Use Whirlwind! "
11,09,122,DUSTOX,[WHIRLWIND MOVE] 
11,09,123,JESSIE,[EXERTION] 
11,09,124,DUSTOX,[EXERTION] 
11,09,125,JESSIE,"Look, no wings, and no strings! "
11,09,126,MARIAN,Look at that! 
11,09,127,JESSIE,You're looking at the future of flying! 
11,09,128,DUSTOX,[EFFORT] 
11,09,129,"JESSIE, DUSTOX",[EFFORT] 
11,09,130,DUSTOX,[EFFORT]

11,09,132,MEOWTH,Yipes! Jessie's schtick got old real quick. 
11,09,133,JAMES,Too avant-garde for the masses. 
11,09,134,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,09,135,ASH,What's up with that? 
11,09,136,BROCK,It's always the same thing with her. 
11,09,137,PIKACHU,[WHISPERING] 
11,09,138,PIPLUP,[AGREEING] 
11,09,139,DAWN,Amazing. 
11,09,140,KENNY,"You've got to say, she's one of a kind. "
11,09,141,JESSIE,Now it's time for the big finish! 
11,09,142,DUSTOX,[EFFORTS] 
11,09,143,JESSIE,Psybeam. Baboom! 
11,09,144,DUSTOX,[PSYBEAM MOVE] 
11,09,145,MARIAN,That's incredible! That Psybeam has collided with those scales and exploded! But what happened to Jessilina? 
11,09,146,DUSTOX,[PROUD] 
11,09,147,JESSIE,Hi. Right here. 
11,09,148,MARIAN,"A phenomenal illusion! The combination of that expl*si*n and scream had us fearing the worst, but Jessilina and Dustox are just fine! "
11,09,149,ASH,They got the biggest hand so far! 
11,09,150,JESSIE,Thank you! I'm drawn to waves of fan adoration like a Psyduck to water! 
11,09,151,CONTESTA,That was the kind of performance you can only get when Pokémon and Coordinator are in perfect harmony. An excellent performance! 
11,09,152,SUKIZO,And don't forget remarkable! 
11,09,153,NURSE JOY,The sight of Dustox's sparkling scales was truly wondrous to behold! 
11,09,154,JAMES,They love her! She's a hit! 
11,09,155,MEOWTH,Now we won't get hit! 
11,09,156,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,09,157,MARIAN,"Next up, let's welcome Dawn! "
11,09,158,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
11,09,159,ASH,"Dawn, stay cool, and you'll be great! "
11,09,160,PIKACHU,[CHEERING] 
11,09,161,DAWN,Ambipom! Spotlight!

11,09,166,"BROCK, ASH, PIPLUP, PIKACHU, BUNEARY, PACHIRISU",[REELING] 
11,09,167,DAWN,"Now, use Swift! "
11,09,168,AMBIPOM,[SWIFT MOVE] 
11,09,169,ASH,Awesome! 
11,09,170,BROCK,"Wow, that's an even better Swift than when those two were practicing it! "
11,09,171,"PIPLUP, PIKACHU, BUNEARY, PACHIRISU",[AMAZED] 
11,09,172,"MARIAN, ZOEY",Dawn and her Ambipom have literally lit the stage with that star-studded Swift move! 
11,09,173,DAWN,"Ambipom, faster! "
11,09,174,AMBIPOM,[SPEEDING UP] 
11,09,175,DAWN,Way to go! 
11,09,176,MARIAN,I've never seen such a brilliant Swift! The stars just keep pouring off it in a non-stop dazzling display! 
11,09,177,JESSIE,Whoa! The Twerpette's even gaudier than me. 
11,09,178,ASH,You gotta love that Rainbow Swift. 
11,09,179,BROCK,Don't you think it's a bit much? 
11,09,180,ASH,"But Brock, it's got to catch the crowd's attention, you know! Right? "
11,09,181,"PIPLUP, PIKACHU, BUNEARY, PACHIRISU",[ENTHRALLED] 
11,09,182,DAWN,"Now finish it up, Ambipom! "
11,09,183,AMBIPOM,[PROUD] 
11,09,184,DAWN,"Wow, you were so great! "
11,09,185,AMBIPOM,[EXCITED] 
11,09,186,"DAWN, AMBIPOM",[LAUGHING] 
11,09,187,KENNY,That Swift was really something. 
11,09,188,DAWN,"Surprised, aren't you? "
11,09,189,ASH,"Dawn, you were great! "
11,09,190,DAWN,"Aw, thanks Ash! "
11,09,191,PIPLUP,[PROUD] 
11,09,192,DAWN,"Piplup, that's sweet! So wasn't Ambipom amazing? "
11,09,193,PIPLUP,[COMPLIMENTING] 
11,09,194,AMBIPOM,[HAPPY] 
11,09,195,MARIAN,"Sorry for the delay, but we have a decision! The Coordinators who have made it past the first stage! "
11,09,196,AMBIPOM,[NERVOUS] 
11,09,197,DAWN,"C'mon, Ambipom! No need to worry. "
11,09,198,DAWN,It's time for us to get ready for the second round! 
11,09,199,AMBIPOM,[HESITANT] 
11,09,200,PIKACHU,[ENCOURAGING] 
11,09,201,PIPLUP,[NERVOUS] 
11,09,202,MARIAN,And now here are the official results. 
11,09,203,MARIAN,The eight Coordinators moving on to the second stage. 
11,09,204,MARIAN,And they're on screen! 
11,09,205,JESSIE,So tell me something I don't know. 
11,09,206,JAMES,We're alive to see another day! 
11,09,207,MEOWTH,It's the gift of life! 
11,09,208,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,09,209,"AMBIPOM, PIPLUP, PACHIRISU, BUNEARY, PIKACHU",[NERVOUS] 
11,09,210,DAWN,What happened? 
11,09,211,AMBIPOM,[HEARTBROKEN] 
11,09,212,"PIKACHU, PIPLUP",[SHOCKED] 
11,09,213,KENNY,Come on. 
11,09,214,ASH,Oh Dawn. 
11,09,215,MARIAN,These eight Coordinators will battle it out in our second round as they compete for the honor of winning the Solaceon Ribbon! 
11,09,216,GLAMEOW,[MEOWING] 
11,09,217,JOHANNA,Poor Dawn. 
11,09,218,MARIAN,So now let's give a look at how our battle cards stack up! The match ups are determined by a random shuffle from our computer! 
11,09,219,PIPLUP,[CURIOUS] 
11,09,220,ASH,Uh... 
11,09,221,DAWN,"Congratulations on making it to the second round, Kenny! "
11,09,222,KENNY,Thanks. 
11,09,223,DAWN,Come on! Chin up! Don't look so sad. 
11,09,224,ASH,But Dawn... 
11,09,225,BROCK,We're sorry you lost! 
11,09,226,DAWN,"No need to worry! You know that! I just had a less than great day out there, and that's all! Come on, Kenny. You've got to get ready for the second round! "
11,09,227,KENNY,"Okay, I hear you! Root for me. "
11,09,228,AMBIPOM,[DISAPPOINTED] 
11,09,229,AMBIPOM,[CURIOUS] 
11,09,230,JESSIE,Thanks for coming. 
11,09,231,DAWN,"Jessilina, hi. "
11,09,232,JESSIE,Now don't let the door hit you on your way out. 
11,09,233,DAWN,I'm staying! Right through to the end! 
11,09,234,KENNY,"Now Prinplup, use Drill Peck! "
11,09,235,PRINPLUP,[DRILL PECK MOVE] 
11,09,236,JESSIE,"Dodge it, and use Psybeam! "
11,09,237,DUSTOX,[PSYBEAM MOVE] 
11,09,238,PRINPLUP,[REELING] 
11,09,239,PRINPLUP,[KNOCKED DOWN] 
11,09,240,ASH,"Come on, Kenny! Do it! "
11,09,241,PIPLUP,[NERVOUS] 
11,09,242,MARIAN,There's less than one minute remaining on the clock! Mere seconds before we find out which of these two takes home the Solaceon Ribbon! 
11,09,243,JESSIE,"Quick, Dustox, Whirlwind! "
11,09,244,DUSTOX,[WHIRLWIND MOVE] 
11,09,245,PRINPLUP,[STARTLED] 
11,09,246,KENNY,Now! Prinplup use Bubble Beam! 
11,09,247,PRINPLUP,[BUBBLE BEAM MOVE] 
11,09,248,JESSIE,Poison Sting! 
11,09,249,DUSTOX,[POISON STING MOVE] 
11,09,250,DUSTOX,[PLEASED] 
11,09,251,JESSIE,Oooh! Dustox dazzles! 
11,09,252,PRINPLUP,[RESIGNED] 
11,09,253,MARIAN,A great performance by Dustox! Being able to use water spray from that Bubble Beam to show off its beautiful wings was inspired strategy! 
11,09,254,KENNY,This's bad! I'm losing all of my points! 
11,09,255,ASH,Look at the time. 
11,09,256,MARIAN,Time's up! All right! And that means the Solaceon Ribbon goes to... 
11,09,257,MARIAN,...Jessilina and Dustox! 
11,09,258,JESSIE,Dear Dustox we actually won! 
11,09,259,PRINPLUP,[SIGH] 
11,09,260,JAMES,Wow! Our Jessie's in the big leagues! 
11,09,261,MEOWTH,Which means we're in the pink! 
11,09,262,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,09,263,MARIAN,"And now it's time to present the Solaceon Ribbon to the winner of today's contest, Jessilina! "
11,09,264,CONTESTA,A marvelous win! Is this your first ribbon? 
11,09,265,JESSIE,You can say the most embarrassing things. 
11,09,266,CONTESTA,I must say the Jessilina we've witnessed today is much more relaxed than I've ever seen! 
11,09,267,SUKIZO,Right! Truly remarkable. 
11,09,268,NURSE JOY,And we're all looking forward to seeing you again! 
11,09,269,MEOWTH,"You know, I think Jessie must have been so carefree, cranked, and confident about winning this time around that not even her brain could catch up! "
11,09,270,JAMES,Especially with a brain that slow. 
11,09,271,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,09,272,JESSIE,"The Solaceon Ribbon, and it's all mine! "
11,09,273,MARIAN,"And that wraps up another exciting Solaceon Town Pokémon Contest! Thanks to you all for coming by for all the fun and excitement, and we'll be keeping a sharp eye out for you at our next contest! "
11,09,274,ASH,Kenny? You're going already? 
11,09,275,KENNY,"Got to get ready for the next contest! And of course you're gonna be there too, right Dee Dee? "
11,09,276,DAWN,I don't think so. Not the next one. I guess. 
11,09,277,KENNY,"Look, Dee Dee. Let's get one thing straight. There's no way I'm gonna let you quit contests at least until I've had a chance to b*at you, understand? "
11,09,278,DAWN,"Okay! No need to worry, I'll be there! "
11,09,279,KENNY,See ya. 
11,09,280,BROCK,Take care of yourself! 
11,09,281,KENNY,"Keep on that Energy Ball, okay Ash? "
11,09,282,ASH,You bet! We'll finish our battle next time! 
11,09,283,KENNY,Yeah! 
11,09,284,DAWN,Oh Mom. I lost again! But how come? I don't know. What am I gonna do? 
11,09,285,ASH,"It's getting late, and Dawn's still not up. "
11,09,286,PIPLUP,[WORRIED] 
11,09,287,ZOEY,I saw the whole thing on TV. 
11,09,288,ASH,Zoey? 
11,09,289,ZOEY,Get up. 
11,09,290,ZOEY,Let's battle! 
11,09,291,ZOEY,"You can partner with Ambipom, and I want a battle based on what you did yesterday. "
11,09,292,"DAWN, PIPLUP",[CONFUSED] 
11,09,293,ZOEY,Let's go! 
11,09,294,DAWN,"All right Ambipom, use Swift! "
11,09,295,AMBIPOM,[SWIFT MOVE] 
11,09,296,ASH,"What's Zoey up to, anyway? "
11,09,297,AMBIPOM,[SHOWING OFF] 
11,09,298,ZOEY,Now think what you're doing. 
11,09,299,ZOEY,"It's a pretty move all right, but the problem is, where's Ambipom? "
11,09,300,ZOEY,In the middle of all that flash Ambipom's disappeared! You've got to remember your Pokémon are the main attraction. 
11,09,301,ZOEY,"You've spent so much time polishing your moves, you've forgotten what you really need to do to show them off! "
11,09,302,ZOEY,"All right Glameow, Iron Tail! "
11,09,303,GLAMEOW,[IRON TAIL MOVE] 
11,09,304,"DAWN, AMBIPOM",[ALARMED] 
11,09,305,GLAMEOW,[SMUG] 
11,09,306,ZOEY,Now Shock Wave! 
11,09,307,GLAMEOW,[SHOCK WAVE MOVE] 
11,09,308,AMBIPOM,[PAINED SCREAM] 
11,09,309,DAWN,Are you okay? 
11,09,310,AMBIPOM,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,09,311,ZOEY,Dawn? 
11,09,312,ZOEY,Do you know why I passed on Solaceon Town after the Hearthome Contest? 
11,09,313,ZOEY,"Everybody gets upset when they lose! When you're not thinking clearly, it's easy to forget what's important. "
11,09,314,ZOEY,"That's why after a loss, I take time off to recharge and get ready for the next challenge! "
11,09,315,ZOEY,I don't worry about ribbons. 
11,09,316,DAWN,Hadn't thought of that. 
11,09,317,ZOEY,I'm sure we'll meet in the finals someday. 
11,09,318,DAWN,"Thanks, Zoey. "
11,09,319,BROCK,Easy does it is the way to go. 
11,09,320,DAWN,Yeah! 
11,09,321,ASH,"Hey, thanks for the great advice, Zoey! "
11,09,322,ZOEY,So where are you headed next? 
11,09,323,ASH,I got a Veilstone Gym battle! 
11,09,324,ZOEY,"Then make sure you win it! A victory might be the best present you could give Dawn too, -you know? "
11,09,325,ASH,Yeah! I hear you. 
11,09,326,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
11,09,327,NARRATOR,Taking defeat and then turning it into the chance to learn and grow stronger is what it's all about. 
11,09,328,NARRATOR,"And so, while Dawn's journey heads in that very direction, it's Ash who's to be facing his own challenge at the Veilstone City Gym next, and we'll be there too! [THEME MUSIC PLAYING"

11,08,14,BROCK,And I'm really impressed with that new variation on Swift you used! 
11,08,15,DAWN,It looks a lot prettier than before! We made a lot of changes on Focus Punch as well! 
11,08,16,AIPOM,[HAPPY] 
11,08,17,DAWN,Piplup. can you be our opponent? 
11,08,18,PIPLUP,[HAPPY]

11,08,30,DAWN,I want it to look like Aipom's attacking two places at once with just one Focus Punch! 
11,08,31,BROCK,You do realize that's a brand new move? 
11,08,32,DAWN,A new move? 
11,08,33,POKEDEX,"Double Hit. A single att*ck, that causes damage twice. "

11,08,40,KENNY,Ambipom.

11,08,61,DAWN,Oh yeah! Ash used to be Aipom's trainer! Remember Aipom in the Jubilife Contest? 
11,08,62,KENNY,That's right! So did you make a trade? 
11,08,63,ASH,Yeah! For Dawn's Buizel!

11,08,80,JESSIE,Team Galactic? Wonder what they're up to. 
11,08,81,JAMES,"No good as always, I'm sure. "
11,08,82,SATURN,The Eterna Historical Museum. I want you three to break in there and steal the Adamant Orb. 
11,08,83,SATURN,"Well, will you do it or not? "
11,08,84,MEOWTH,What's this joint?

11,08,93,KENNY,These are the Solaceon Ruins! 
11,08,94,KENNY,The ruins of the temple where people once paid tribute to Dialga and Palkia. There are lots of places like this in Sinnoh! 
11,08,95,ASH,Wow.

11,08,99,KENNY,That's so true! 
11,08,100,DAWN,Cynthia the Elite Champion once told us that saying. 
11,08,101,KENNY,"Wow, that's so cool that you got to meet the Champion! "
11,08,102,DAWN,I guess that means I have a much more exciting life than you. 
11,08,103,BROCK,"Hey, it says the same thing here! "
11,08,104,ASH,I wonder if it has something to do with Dialga and Palkia. 
11,08,105,KENNY,I've got a good idea: Let's battle now. 
11,08,106,ASH,With Dialga and Palkia staring at us? 
11,08,107,ASH,That sounds like a great idea! 
11,08,108,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
11,08,109,KENNY,Who gets to att*ck first? 
11,08,110,ASH,Um. That's a good question. 
11,08,111,DAWN,In cases like this I've got just the thing! 
11,08,112,KENNY,A Coin Toss application? 
11,08,113,DAWN,"Don't have one, huh? "
11,08,114,KENNY,I hate this. 
11,08,115,DAWN,"This is heads, and this is tails. "
11,08,116,DAWN,"Okay guys, you call it! The winner goes first. "
11,08,117,ASH,"Okay, I'll take heads! "
11,08,118,KENNY,And I'll take tails! 
11,08,119,DAWN,Okay! Coin toss! -
11,08,120,DAWN,It's heads! -
11,08,121,ASH,I get first att*ck! 
11,08,122,KENNY,Let's have a one-on-one battle! 
11,08,123,ASH,You got it! 
11,08,124,DAWN,Oh yeah! I'd forgotten Team Rocket messed up their last battle in Floaroma Town! 
11,08,125,BROCK,That match up was Pikachu versus Prinplup. Wonder about now! 
11,08,126,ASH,Kenny's got to use Prinplup this time too! 
11,08,127,ASH,"So I'll win it with a Grass type! Pikachu, you watch! "
11,08,128,PIKACHU,[AGREEING]

11,08,132,BRELOOM,[APPEARING] 
11,08,133,ASH,What? 
11,08,134,DAWN,That's a Breloom? 
11,08,135,POKEDEX,"Breloom. The Mushroom Pokémon. Its short arms stretch when it throws punches, and its technique is as good as a professional boxer. "
11,08,136,BROCK,Grass-type moves don't do much on Grass-type Pokémon. Why Breloom against Turtwig? 
11,08,137,DAWN,"Well, knowing Kenny, I think his main concern is showing off how good its moves look! "
11,08,138,PIPLUP,[AGREEMENT] 
11,08,139,ASH,"Okay Turtwig, Tackle! "
11,08,140,TURTWIG,[EXERTION]

11,08,157,BROCK,Kenny must have been training really hard! 
11,08,158,KENNY,"You've got to admit, my Breloom's good! "

11,08,174,BROCK,That has to be Breloom's finishing move!

11,08,176,PIPLUP,[AGREEING] 
11,08,177,KENNY,"I'm glad we're using two Grass types, since it keeps the damage to a minimum. "
11,08,178,ASH,"Hey, Kenny! "
11,08,179,ASH,Do you think you could teach Turtwig that move? 
11,08,180,KENNY,Energy Ball?

11,07,83,MATTHEW,"I received a threatening letter from the Bandit Beauties Three, stating they were planning on stealing it! "
11,07,84,ASH,"I gotta say, that's a weird name. "
11,07,85,MARBLE,"Their letter said they were super-famous, but it doesn't sound to me like you've ever heard of them. "
11,07,86,MATTHEW,"But since you can't take any chances with a priceless treasure like the Old Charm, I've asked Officer Jenny and her team for assistance. "
11,07,87,BROCK,You mean Jenny from Mahogany Town? 
11,07,88,MATTHEW,"Uh. Why, yes! "
11,07,89,MARBLE,"And that's why Jenny's trainee number one, me, came to investigate you! "

11,07,91,DAWN,Number one?

11,07,94,MARBLE,"Yes! Not to worry, as Luxray and I will solve this mystery! "
11,07,95,DAWN,Do you think she can handle it? 
11,07,96,MATTHEW,"Well, I couldn't refuse since she came all this way. Say, wait. "
11,07,97,MATTHEW,Perhaps you all could help us! 
11,07,98,ASH,Sounds good! What do you say? 
11,07,99,"BROCK, DAWN",Sure! 
11,07,100,MARBLE,Well... 
11,07,101,"ASH, BROCK, DAWN, PIKACHU",[CONFUSED]

11,07,104,MARBLE,"Come on, it'll be great! "
11,07,105,MARBLE,"You'll have Marble, Ace Detective, as your boss! "
11,07,106,ASH,So the Old Charm's in there? 
11,07,107,MARBLE,Right! The Bandit Beauties' letter said they would steal it at precisely :. 
11,07,108,DAWN,Then all we have to do is stand guard. 
11,07,109,MARBLE,"I know it sounds easy, but there's one thing that worries me. "
11,07,110,"ASH, BROCK, DAWN, PIKACHU",[SURPRISED] 
11,07,111,MARBLE,I'm concerned about Luxray!

11,07,134,MARBLE,"Since then, things have gotten much, much worse. "
11,07,135,MARBLE,Luxray won't listen to a thing I say! 
11,07,136,MARBLE,Even the Arcanine don't like to come around anymore! 
11,07,137,ASH,I see. 
11,07,138,DAWN,"So is that why, when you saw Pikachu's Thunderbolt... "
11,07,139,MARBLE,"I was hoping, if Luxray could learn some Electric-type moves, maybe Luxray would listen to me again. "
11,07,140,ASH,Then this sounds like special training time! 
11,07,141,MARBLE,"But when Luxray gets angry, things can get really, really scary. "

11,06,150,ALAN,My big dream's come true! It evolved into Probopass! And now this. This had to happen! 
11,06,151,ASH,Hang in there. Time for that burning spirit to pay off! 
11,06,152,BROCK,We'll all work together and get Probopass back! 
11,06,153,DAWN,This is definitely not the time to give up! 
11,06,154,PIKACHU,[ENCOURAGING] 
11,06,155,ALAN,"Gee, thanks, guys, you're right! Probopass, everything'll be just fine! "
11,06,156,ASH,"Don't forget, we never finished our battle! We can do that after we get Probopass back! "
11,06,157,ALAN,Sounds good! 
11,06,158,JESSIE,Our premier Probopass calls for a little R and R! 
11,06,159,MEOWTH,"And with all the Nosepass Trainers traipsing through these parts, we should be able to pick up a few more in no time! "
11,06,160,JESSIE,"And after they all evolve, we'll have a veritable army of invulnerable Probopass! "
11,06,161,JAMES,"Invulnerable is nice, but an extra hand wouldn't hurt either! "
11,06,162,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
11,06,163,JAMES,Why is it you get to lounge while I labor with little technical support? 
11,06,164,JESSIE,"I don't do labor! Believe you me, the trappings of being a star put more than enough stress on me as it is! "
11,06,165,MEOWTH,"Making antennas ain't just labor, it's a labor of love! Nothing demeaning about that. "
11,06,166,JAMES,That was clear as mud. 
11,06,167,MEOWTH,Those antennas allow us to control all those Probopass! 
11,06,168,MEOWTH,And whoever controls the Probopass controls the world! 
11,06,169,JAMES,"When you put it that way, then I'm an antenna-making machine! This is the way we make the antenna, make the antenna, make the antenna, so early in the morning! "
11,06,170,BROCK,The only way we'll ever get Probopass back is to take off the antenna or destroy the remote control. 
11,06,171,ALAN,"Okay, I'll aim for the antenna! "
11,06,172,ASH,You leave the remote control to me! 
11,06,173,DAWN,That must be from Probopass's magnetic charge! 
11,06,174,BROCK,We're getting close! 
11,06,175,ALAN,"Probopass, I'm on my way! "
11,06,176,ASH,"Alan, wait up! "
11,06,177,PIKACHU,[CALLING] 
11,06,178,DAWN,"Wow, look at all the antennas! "
11,06,179,ASH,They must want to steal the Nosepass that come here to evolve into Probopass! 
11,06,180,PIKACHU,[DISGUSTED] 
11,06,181,ALAN,"They do, huh? "
11,06,182,ALAN,I'll take care of this right now! 
11,06,183,BROCK,Hold on! 
11,06,184,BROCK,You'll just be att*cked! 
11,06,185,ALAN,You're right.

11,06,191,MEOWTH,"And you, my pointy pal of mine, would make an awesome present for the Boss! If he placed you in his garden, why, you could keep all of his plants in their rows! "
11,06,192,MEOWTH,"Hey, who splished me? "
11,06,193,MEOWTH,"Come on, I already took a bath! "
11,06,194,JESSIE,That's not funny! 
11,06,195,MEOWTH,"Hey, don't look at me, I don't like splishing either! "
11,06,196,JESSIE,"All right, then who does? "
11,06,197,JAMES,Not me! One splash and the antennas are trash!

11,04,31,ASH,"Whoa, check that out! "
11,04,32,DAWN,It's getting cloudy. 
11,04,33,DAWN,"Hey, where's that chill coming from?! "
11,04,34,DAWN,I'm getting goose bumps. 
11,04,35,ASH,"There's something really weird about this, "
11,04,36,PIKACHU,[CONCERNED] 
11,04,37,"ASH, DAWN, BROCK, PIKACHU, BUIZEL, AIPOM",[SCARED]

11,04,40,DAWN,What's that? 
11,04,41,"ASH, DAWN, BROCK, PIKACHU, BUIZEL, AIPOM",[STARTLED] 
11,04,42,SPIRITOMB,[MOANING] 
11,04,43,BROCK,That's a Pokémon? 
11,04,44,POKEDEX,"Spiritomb. The Forbidden Pokémon. As punishment for misdeeds five hundred years ago, it was imprisoned in the fissure of an odd keystone. "
11,04,45,ASH,Spiritomb?

11,04,47,"ASH, DAWN, BROCK, PIKACHU, BUIZEL, AIPOM",[PANICKED]

11,04,56,DAWN,What was that about? 
11,04,57,JESSIE,Yay! Time for a sweet dinner treat that's fun to eat! 
11,04,58,JAMES,It'd be more fun with a little heat. 
11,04,59,MEOWTH,What a b*at. 
11,04,60,JESSIE,Just try it it's neat! Bon appetit! 
11,04,61,"MEOWTH, JAMES",Bon appetit. 
11,04,62,SPIRITOMB,[MOANING] 
11,04,63,JESSIE,"No sharing, you two! "

11,04,65,SPIRITOMB,[DARK PULSE MOVE] 
11,04,66,JESSIE,If we wanted them burnt we would've burnt them! 
11,04,67,SPIRITOMB,[MOANING] 
11,04,68,JESSIE,Who was that iron chef? 
11,04,69,JAMES,"Well, the cards claim it's called Spiritomb! "
11,04,70,JAMES,And what conked you on the cranium is a keystone! 
11,04,71,JAMES,Though why it toasted our tidbits is beyond me. 
11,04,72,MEOWTH,No recipe? 
11,04,73,JESSIE,You've toasted your last roast! And now it's your turn to get on the spit! Nobody messes around with my meal! 
11,04,74,ASH,I'd sure like to figure out what that Spiritomb was doing here in the first place. 
11,04,75,PIKACHU,[CURIOUS] 
11,04,76,DAWN,Yeah and in such a nasty mood as well! 
11,04,77,BROCK,Oh yeah! 
11,04,78,ASH,Check it out! 
11,04,79,DAWN,Something terrible has happened! 
11,04,80,BOY,"Please Raticate, be okay! "
11,04,81,GIRL,"Parasect, say something! "
11,04,82,ASH,What happened? 
11,04,83,BOY,Some kind of creepy Pokémon just att*cked us all out of nowhere! And none of us did anything! 
11,04,84,ASH,I wonder... 
11,04,85,DAWN,Sounds like it could've been Spiritomb. 
11,04,86,BROCK,"After what we saw, I'd agree! "
11,04,87,OLD LADY,It was Spiritomb! 
11,04,88,OLD LADY,The evil Spiritomb's been reborn it's got to be true! 
11,04,89,DAWN,"Excuse me, I'm having a little trouble following you. "
11,04,90,OLD LADY,Then loosen up that little white cap of yours honey! The seal holding Spiritomb has been smashed! 
11,04,91,ASH,I'm still not sure what you're talking about. 
11,04,92,OLD LADY,Good thing I am! 
11,04,93,"ASH, DAWN, BROCK",Then won't you explain it to us? 
11,04,94,OLD LADY,There's a village legend going back a long time that tells all about how Spiritomb was sealed away. 
11,04,95,DAWN,Sealed away? 
11,04,96,OLD LADY,You heard right. There was a wicked Pokémon named Spiritomb. It caused terrible trouble for the folks living around here! It did everything it could to make their lives miserable! 
11,04,97,OLD LADY,Always messing with the fruit the villagers were trying to pick and destroying everybody's homes! 
11,04,98,OLD LADY,Nothing could be done to stop Spiritomb and those villagers were one step away from being at their wits end! 
11,04,99,OLD LADY,"When all of a sudden, an Aura Guardian came wandering right into their village! "
11,04,100,ASH,An Aura Guardian! 
11,04,101,OLD LADY,And this Aura Guardian had a Pikachu with him! 
11,04,102,OLD LADY,"They told him about their troubles, and he battled Spiritomb on behalf of the village! "
11,04,103,OLD LADY,"Then, after bravely defeating Spiritomb, the Aura Guardian sealed it in a keystone deep inside a stone hallowed tower to make certain it wouldn't cause anyone any harm ever again! "
11,04,104,OLD LADY,"The village was saved, and everyone lived happily ever after! "
11,04,105,OLD LADY,"So, you wanted to hear the legend and now you have! "
11,04,106,ASH,Hallowed tower huh? 
11,04,107,DAWN,Made out of stone huh? 
11,04,108,BROCK,Are you thinking what I'm thinking? 
11,04,109,OLD LADY,The stone hallowed tower's nothing but a heap of rubble! 
11,04,110,OLD LADY,You kids did this didn't you? 
11,04,111,ASH,"It was just an accident, see? "
11,04,112,DAWN,We were using Buizel's Sonic Boom when we mistakenly knocked it down! 
11,04,113,BROCK,"Of course, there's no way we could've known anything about your legend! "
11,04,114,OLD LADY,"So it was you, you little pipsqueaks! "
11,04,115,"ASH, BROCK, DAWN",We're really sorry and we won't do it again! 
11,04,116,PIKACHU,[APOLOGIZING] 
11,04,117,OLD LADY,First it's sealed up by the Aura Guardian and his Pikachu and now that awful wicked Spiritomb's been unsealed by a well-meaning but reckless group of kids with a young man who just happens to have a Pikachu too! 
11,04,118,OLD LADY,Those ways of fate can sure be mighty strange. 
11,04,119,ASH,Since we're the ones who broke that seal we'll make it right! You can count on it! 
11,04,120,OLD LADY,Well that's mighty big talk but you'd better keep in mind that Spiritomb is one mean and nasty Pokémon! 
11,04,121,JESSIE,"Excuse me, but we happened to overhear all that big talk. "
11,04,122,BROCK,"Whoa, who are you? "
11,04,123,JESSIE,Moi? I'm a renowned combination mystic psychic and hairdresser! 
11,04,124,JAMES,And I'm her Guy Friday! 
11,04,125,DAWN,You mean like the ones on TV that tell celebrities about their past lives and predict their future? 
11,04,126,JESSIE,I can see what can't be seen and tell what can't be told! Like I'm going to do now! 
11,04,127,JESSIE,You with the Pikachu! 
11,04,128,ASH,Me? 
11,04,129,JESSIE,It's as clear as your clueless stare! 
11,04,130,JESSIE,"The stars tell me that your spirit guide is conducting Pokémon research! A true, blue Pokémon man! "
11,04,131,JESSIE,"I see him! Red shirt, white lab coat, endlessly writing Pokémon poems "
11,04,132,ASH,"Hey, that's Professor Oak! "
11,04,133,BROCK,"But, just one thing: he's still alive! "
11,04,134,ASH,He sure is! 
11,04,135,JESSIE,And I can see your past lives! 
11,04,136,DAWN,I've got those? 
11,04,137,JESSIE,You're all good at that clueless stare stuff! 
11,04,138,JESSIE,You lived once as Slowpoke! 
11,04,139,DAWN,You mean I was a Pokémon in a past life? As a Slowpoke? 
11,04,140,JESSIE,And your spirit guide is... 
11,04,141,"JAMES, MEOWTH",Her! Sharpedo teeth! 
11,04,142,OLD LADY,"Excuse me, but I haven't departed this world quite yet. "
11,04,143,JESSIE,Could've fooled me ma'am! 
11,04,144,JAMES,Our psychic Sneasel has the gift of communication with other Pokémon via mental telepathy! 
11,04,145,MEOWTH,Sneasel snee! 
11,04,146,DAWN,Wow no joke? 
11,04,147,MEOWTH,Sneasel snee! 
11,04,148,JESSIE,And that means you can leave the unpleasant task of dealing with that saucy Spiritomb to us! 
11,04,149,JESSIE,We'll simply use one swipe to catch both Spiritomb and Pikachu! 
11,04,150,BOY B,"Hey! Granny, help! "
11,04,151,BOY B,That bad Spiritomb's attacking us again! 
11,04,152,"ASH, DAWN, OLD LADY, BROCK, PIKACHU",[SHOCKED] 
11,04,153,ASH,"Look, there's Spiritomb! "
11,04,154,JESSIE,"All right, Sneasel, do your thing! "
11,04,155,MEOWTH,Sneasel snee! 
11,04,156,MEOWTH,"Sneasel, Sneasel Sneasel! "
11,04,157,SPIRITOMB,[CONFUSED] 
11,04,158,MEOWTH,"Snea, Sneasel Sneasel! "
11,04,159,ASH,What are they doing? 
11,04,160,JAMES,At this very moment Sneasel is using telepathy to explore the demonic depths of Spiritomb's thoughts! 
11,04,161,DAWN,"But, it looks to me like the two of them are just talking! "
11,04,162,MEOWTH,"Sneasel snea, snea snea, sneasel snea "
11,04,163,JAMES,Sneasel says Spiritomb wants something from Pikachu! 
11,04,164,ASH,Like what? 
11,04,165,PIKACHU,[CONFUSED] 
11,04,166,JESSIE,"Well then, mustn't let Mister Nasty wait! Chop chop! Come along! "
11,04,167,SPIRITOMB,[CONFUSED] 
11,04,168,JESSIE,I will now re-seal this floating troublemaker by utilizing my psychic powers! 
11,04,169,JESSIE,"Hocus pocus! Ready, get set. Put its bad self in the net! "
11,04,170,"SPIRITOMB, PIKACHU",[STARTLED] 
11,04,171,JAMES,And goal! 
11,04,172,JESSIE,"Soon, they'll be casting a spell on the boss! "
11,04,173,MEOWTH,"So, let's get our ride and slide! "
11,04,174,ASH,"No, you don't! "
11,04,175,JESSIE,Being clueless can be a bad habit! 
11,04,176,JESSIE,I don't have to be psychic to know the truth 
11,04,177,JAMES,Especially when dealing with Twerpish youth! 
11,04,178,JESSIE,On the wind! 
11,04,179,JAMES,The stars! 
11,04,180,MEOWTH,"Yeah, forsooth! "
11,04,181,JESSIE,Bringing chaos at a break neck pace! 
11,04,182,JAMES,"Dashing hope, putting fear in its place! "
11,04,183,JESSIE,A mystic psychic by any other name is just as smart! 
11,04,184,JAMES,We've turned fooling you dumb Twerps into an art! 
11,04,185,JESSIE,Jessie! 
11,04,186,JAMES,And James! 
11,04,187,MEOWTH,"Meowth, that's a name! "
11,04,188,JESSIE,Putting the do-gooders in their place! 
11,04,189,JAMES,We're Team Rocket! 
11,04,190,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",In your face! 
11,04,191,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",Our ride is here so we're out of here! 
11,04,192,ASH,Team Rocket come back! 
11,04,193,OLD LADY,If they think they can capture Spiritomb they're dumber than they look! 
11,04,194,SPIRITOMB,[DARK PULSE MOVE] 
11,04,195,JAMES,You could've warned us first! 
11,04,196,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH, PIKACHU",[DAZED]

11,04,207,JAMES,I hate echoed screaming! 
11,04,208,SPIRITOMB,[HOWLING] 
11,04,209,SPIRITOMB,[HOWLING] 
11,04,210,ASH,Spiritomb showed Team Rocket a thing or two! 
11,04,211,DAWN,"Wow, was it angry! "
11,04,212,OLD LADY,They're much dumber than they look! 
11,04,213,JESSIE,Can't take another step. 
11,04,214,SPIRITOMB,[MOANING] 
11,04,215,JESSIE,"We give up! But please, please for badness sake... "
11,04,216,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",Just once. Give us a break! 
11,04,217,SPIRITOMB,[EXPLAINING] 
11,04,218,JESSIE,You get that? 
11,04,219,MEOWTH,Well I'm the only one speaking the lingo around here. Spiritomb wants revenge big-time on the Aura Guardian that sealed it up in that keystone! 
11,04,220,JESSIE,Now let's review: How long ago did this take place? 
11,04,221,JAMES, years or so. 
11,04,222,JESSIE,Those who live in the past are doomed to repeat it! 
11,04,223,JESSIE,"Before we hash this out, look! "
11,04,224,SPIRITOMB,[CURIOUS] 
11,04,225,JESSIE,Ciao! 
11,04,226,"MEOWTH, JAMES",Hasta la vista!

11,04,229,ASH,"Staravia, did ya spot Spiritomb yet? "
11,04,230,STARAVIA,[NEGATIVE] 
11,04,231,DAWN,Where do you think Spiritomb could have gone? 
11,04,232,BROCK,What if Spiritomb found another village? 
11,04,233,ASH,"Guys, we've got to make sure that doesn't happen! "
11,04,234,DAWN,"Wait! We just saw Spiritomb chasing Team Rocket, right? "
11,04,235,ASH,Uh huh. 
11,04,236,DAWN,"So, that means if we can lure Team Rocket here, then Spiritomb may come along too! "
11,04,237,ASH,You're right! That might work! 
11,04,238,BROCK,Yeah. Especially since nothing else has. What next? 
11,04,239,DAWN,"Okay, here's the plan. Listen up! "
11,04,240,JESSIE,"Scary, but not too smart. "
11,04,241,JAMES,Spiritomb's as feisty as an Aura Guardian! 
11,04,242,MEOWTH,Every time we're close to plucking Pikachu our eyes get too big! 
11,04,243,JAMES,"Well, widen your eyes now! "
11,04,244,JESSIE,Pikachu! Taking a snooze in the meadow are we? 
11,04,245,MEOWTH,With nary a Twerp in sight to cause trouble! 
11,04,246,JAMES,This is our lucky day! 
11,04,247,JESSIE,"Excuse me! 'Twas because of my - brilliant strategy, not luck! -"
11,04,248,"MEOWTH, JAMES",Please! 
11,04,249,PIKACHU,[TAUNTING] 
11,04,250,"JAMES, JESSIE, MEOWTH",Hey!

11,04,252,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",Twerps? 
11,04,253,ASH,"Listen, is that bad guy talk I hear? "
11,04,254,DAWN,It speaks to me loud and clear! 
11,04,255,ASH,On the wind! 
11,04,256,DAWN,Past the stars! 
11,04,257,BROCK,In your ear! 
11,04,258,JESSIE,It's that kind of imitation they invented lawsuits for! 
11,04,259,DAWN,Chill out! We couldn't care less about you! 
11,04,260,ASH,We're looking for Spiritomb! 
11,04,261,SPIRITOMB,[HOWLING] 
11,04,262,ASH,That's strategy. 
11,04,263,DAWN,Who are the Twerps now? 
11,04,264,JESSIE,I won't be treated like a piece of garbage! 
11,04,265,MEOWTH,You're a little late. 
11,04,266,JESSIE,I think it's time for those Twerps to reap what they sow! 
11,04,267,JAMES,Let's go! 
11,04,268,MEOWTH,"Your highness! If it's total unmerciful revenge you want, have I got the perfect sap for you! "
11,04,269,JESSIE,That Twerp with the perched Pikachu is a descendant of the Aura Guardian who sealed you in that crazy keystone! 
11,04,270,ASH,You mean me? 
11,04,271,PIKACHU,[CONFUSED] 
11,04,272,SPIRITOMB,[HYPER BEAM MOVE]

11,04,290,JESSIE,Perfect! The wrath of Spiritomb is being unloaded on the Twerp and his Pikachu! 
11,04,291,JESSIE,And once Pikachu's pounded to a pulp we'll go and grab what's left!

11,03,154,AIPOM,[SURPRISED] 
11,03,155,ZOEY,"But even so, it looks awfully nice! "
11,03,156,DAWN,Of course it does! Aipom's always watching Piplup and me while we're training! 
11,03,157,PIPLUP,[PROUD]

11,03,169,AIPOM,[CHEER] 
11,03,170,ZOEY,Wait! Hold on just a minute you two. 
11,03,171,ZOEY,Remember what I told you at the Jubilife Contest? About Aipom being raised by Dawn? 
11,03,172,DAWN,"Of course, I remember. "
11,03,173,ASH,"Oh yeah, I remember too! "
11,03,174,ZOEY,"Just watching you all train, I realize that I was right! "
11,03,175,ZOEY,It's obvious that Aipom loves to perform! 
11,03,176,ZOEY,While at the same time I get the feeling you're forcing Buizel into Contests. 
11,03,177,DAWN,You think so? 
11,03,178,ZOEY,"So I say, why don't you two just make a Pokémon trade? "
11,03,179,"ASH, DAWN",Pokémon trade? 
11,03,180,AIPOM,[CONFUSED] 
11,03,181,ASH,That's weird. I never would have thought of something like that! 
11,03,182,CHIMCHAR,[CONFUSED] 
11,03,183,PIKACHU,[CONFUSED] 
11,03,184,JESSIE,Hmm. It sounds like the Twerps are toying with a trade! 
11,03,185,MEOWTH,Think of it! You put that Buizel together with the kid in the cap and they'd rock hard! 
11,03,186,JESSIE,And if you remember when Aipom and I teamed up we won that Contest hands down! 
11,03,187,MEOWTH,"Yeah, maybe. But all I cared about was winning bananas. "
11,03,188,WOBBUFFET,[AGREEING] 
11,03,189,JESSIE,"Quiet, big mouth! We can't let the Twerps go through with a Poké-pass play! The only logical solution is to Team Rocketize their Pokémon! "
11,03,190,MEOWTH,Aipom and Buizel? 
11,03,191,JESSIE,I'll take Aipom for myself. After that I'll give Buizel to James! And that will mend his Cacnea-less broken heart once and for all! 
11,03,192,MEOWTH,You made sense! 
11,03,193,WOBBUFFET,[AGREEING] 
11,03,194,JESSIE,I'll make more than that! I'll hoist our team to new heights and we'll make millions!

11,03,213,JOY,"Of course, I understand. "
11,03,214,JOY,"You've worked hard to catch and raise your Pokémon, and you have so many wonderful memories! "
11,03,215,DAWN,"It's just not easy to go through with this! I know Aipom loves Pokémon Contests, but I also know Aipom loves Ash. "
11,03,216,ASH,"The thing is, I've seen how much Dawn has put into Buizel's training, you know? "
11,03,217,JOY,"A trainer's job is to work hard to bring out the very best in a Pokémon, but there's one thing. "
11,03,218,JOY,"Instead of a Pokémon adjusting to its trainer, the fact is a trainer needs to adjust to their Pokémon! "
11,03,219,ASH,"Whoa, I never thought of it that way. "
11,03,220,"ASH, AIPOM",[CONFUSED] 
11,03,221,ASH,"Hey, I just got a great idea! "
11,03,222,"PIKACHU, AIPOM",[CURIOUS]

11,03,224,ASH,"I'll team up with Buizel, and we'll have a battle against Brock! And you team up with Aipom and have a Contest battle against Zoey! "

11,02,152,GARDENIA,Drain Punch is a stronger move than Needle Arm! All you do is have Cacnea twist its arm inward while it hits! 
11,02,153,JAMES,Of course! Easy for you to say. 
11,02,154,AIPOM,[FOCUS PUNCH MOVE] 
11,02,155,JAMES,"Now Cacnea, Drain Punch! Twist your arm inward while you hit! "
11,02,156,CACNEA,[DRAIN PUNCH MOVE]

11,02,160,ASH,Aipom! 
11,02,161,JAMES,Wow! Drain Punch worked! 
11,02,162,CHILD A,What a Drain Punch! 
11,02,163,MEOWTH,Surprise! 
11,02,164,JESSIE,Who knew Cacnea had that much kick? 
11,02,165,CACNEA,[AMAZED] 
11,02,166,GARDENIA,Just like I thought. 
11,02,167,CHILD B,Turtwig!

11,02,188,CACNEA,[CRASHING] 
11,02,189,BROCK,That's it! Turtwig and Cacnea are unable to battle! So the winners are Pachirisu and Aipom! 
11,02,190,ASH,"We did it! You were great, Aipom! "
11,02,191,DAWN,You too Pachirisu! 
11,02,192,"AIPOM, PACHIRISU",[CHEERING] 
11,02,193,JESSIE,All's stinky that ends stinky 
11,02,194,CHILD B,I can't believe Gardenia lost. 
11,02,195,CHILD A,It was the old man's fault! 
11,02,196,CHILD B,Yeah it's your fault! Old man! 
11,02,197,JAMES,I'm not too old to put all of you across my knee!

11,02,202,CACNEA,[SIGHING] 
11,02,203,JAMES,You did your very best! 
11,02,204,GARDENIA,I knew it! I was right about your Cacnea! 
11,02,205,JAMES,What do you mean? 
11,02,206,GARDENIA,"When I saw that Needle Arm, I knew Cacnea was super strong! "
11,02,207,GARDENIA,And that's when it hit me! Your Cacnea could probably learn Drain Punch! 
11,02,208,BROCK,Which is why you suggested it to James in the first place! 
11,02,209,DAWN,But then why didn't Drain Punch work the nd time? 
11,02,210,CACNEA,[EXPLAINING] 
11,02,211,MEOWTH,Cacnea says it was just an accident it worked at all. 
11,02,212,GARDENIA,No way! That Cacnea is something special! That's why it worked. 
11,02,213,GARDENIA,"But Cacnea still needs a lot of training, and Trainer and Pokémon need to be in perfect sync. "
11,02,214,JAMES,"So, it was my fault? "
11,02,215,GARDENIA,What I'd like to do is take on your Cacnea and train it myself! 
11,02,216,GARDENIA,I've got high hopes for Cacnea. 
11,02,217,CHILD A,"Gardenia, please? Show us some other Pokémon! "
11,02,218,CHILDREN,"Please, Gardenia, please? "
11,02,219,GARDENIA,All right! What do you say we all go to the Pokémon Center? 
11,02,220,JESSIE,What nerve! Little Miss Green Ego. 
11,02,221,PIKACHU,[CONFUSED] 
11,02,222,JESSIE,Those two sad sacks. They are pathetic! 
11,02,223,JESSIE,Snap out of it! Don't let that grassy know-it-all bum you out! 
11,02,224,JAMES,"Jess, she's not bumming me a bit! "
11,02,225,JESSIE,"Tell the truth! You're actually thinking of giving Cacnea to that goofy Gym Leader, aren't you? "
11,02,226,JAMES,"Come on, that's just crazy talk! I think. "
11,02,227,JESSIE,You think? There is one thing Team Rocket is definitely not and that's a charity! 
11,02,228,MEOWTH,Always thinking about the bottom line. 
11,02,229,CACNEA,[DEMANDING] 
11,02,230,MEOWTH,Cacnea says it wants to learn to use Drain Punch! -
11,02,231,CACNEA,[AGREEING] -
11,02,232,JAMES,Oh Cacnea. 
11,02,233,CACNEA,[FLEXING] 
11,02,234,MEOWTH,Hey you're right! If you knew Drain Punch we wouldn't be in this mess in the first place! 
11,02,235,JAMES,Of course! All right then! Let's train! 
11,02,236,CACNEA,[EXCITED] 
11,02,237,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH, CACNEA",[SURPRISED] 
11,02,238,JESSIE,I'd know those Twerpish outlines anywhere! 
11,02,239,ASH,Team Rocket? 
11,02,240,DAWN,They won't leave! 
11,02,241,JESSIE,"You know, I just had an idea! "
11,02,242,MEOWTH,Spit it out! 
11,02,243,JESSIE,"If we could partner with the Twerps to train, we could get Cacnea to learn Drain Punch and a slew of other stuff! "
11,02,244,MEOWTH,Sure enough! 
11,02,245,JAMES,Right! Are we ready to learn? 
11,02,246,CACNEA,[EXCITED] 
11,02,247,JAMES,Cacnea! Use Drain Punch! 
11,02,248,CACNEA,[ATTEMPTING] [SURPRISED] 
11,02,249,JAMES,Cacnea! One more time! Use Drain Punch! 
11,02,250,CACNEA,[TRYING] 
11,02,251,ASH,"Uh, so I guess that means they're doing some special Drain Punch training. "
11,02,252,DAWN,Even Team Rocket does things the right way once in a while. 
11,02,253,JESSIE,Excuse me. We've done the right thing lots of times! 
11,02,254,BROCK,"Well, whatever the truth is, this is one of them! "
11,02,255,JAMES,Practice makes perfect! One more time! 
11,02,256,JAMES,Dear me. 
11,02,257,CACNEA,[SAD] 
11,02,258,JESSIE,Sad. It's just so hard to find a good training partner these days. 
11,02,259,MEOWTH,Now what's a poor Pokémon to do? 
11,02,260,ASH,"Hey Pikachu! Why don't you and I help them train, huh? "
11,02,261,"DAWN, BROCK, PIKACHU",[SURPRISED] 
11,02,262,"JESSIE, MEOWTH",Yes! 
11,02,263,JESSIE,"Say, aren't you kind! "
11,02,264,MEOWTH,"Mighty big of you Twerps! I mean, folks! "
11,02,265,DAWN,"Hold on Ash! If we help them out with their special training and Cacnea learns Drain Punch, then we're just putting ourselves in danger right? "
11,02,266,ASH,"Hey come on Dawn! It's our job to help anybody who's serious about training their Pokémon in the right way! Right, Pikachu? "
11,02,267,PIKACHU,[AGREEING] 
11,02,268,JAMES,Your kindness knows no bounds! 
11,02,269,ASH,All right! 
11,02,270,ASH,"Are you ready to go, Cacnea? "
11,02,271,CACNEA,[READY] 
11,02,272,ASH,"Okay, now just remember that Gardenia said you're really strong, got it? "
11,02,273,ASH,"So if you add some more movement to your Needle Arm, I'll bet you'll be able to pull off Drain Punch! "
11,02,274,JAMES,We've got it! 
11,02,275,ASH,Pikachu! Use Quick att*ck!

11,02,300,DAWN,Boy I really thought Drain Punch would work this time! 
11,02,301,BROCK,Not quite. Their timing is still bad. And the Trainer's commands are not much better! 
11,02,302,BROCK,"Uh, it's nothing personal I swear! "

11,02,308,DAWN,Maybe and then we'll be regretting it in no time! 
11,02,309,ASH,"Keep it up Cacnea, awesome! "

11,02,317,JESSIE,What a shame. He's even more pathetic than yesterday! 
11,02,318,MEOWTH,"Though, with James that's not exactly newsworthy. "
11,02,319,DAWN,He's taking it hard! 
11,02,320,JESSIE,This all started when I asked him if he was serious about giving Cacnea over to that potted Gym Leader. 
11,02,321,JESSIE,"And then, wham. "
11,02,322,JAMES,It's always the same. 
11,02,323,JAMES,Nothing ever changes. 
11,02,324,GARDENIA,What I'd like to do is take on your Cacnea and train it myself! 
11,02,325,JAMES,How am I supposed to measure up to that kind of Grass-type expertise? 
11,02,326,JAMES,I'm in Team Rocket. One of the bad guys! She's a Gym Leader. 
11,02,327,JAMES,"And it's not just learning Drain Punch. If she took you under her wing, you'd become a stronger Pokémon than I could ever make you. "
11,02,328,JAMES,"If you stay with me, perhaps you'll never be happy, or fulfilled. Maybe she can give you a better life than I can give you! "

10,52,222,CHIMCHAR,[SURPRISE] [GRUNT]

10,52,225,CONWAY,Revenge! 
10,52,226,HERACROSS,[FOCUSED] 
10,52,227,ENTA,And Heracross protects Buizel using careful timing! But look out. 
10,52,228,HERACROSS,[SURPRISE] 
10,52,229,ENTA,"And again! Revenge is sweet with a second strike, which means twice the power with one sh*t! "
10,52,230,ASH,"Look Paul if we don't start battling these guys together, - we're going lose this time! - "
10,52,231,PAUL,So what if we do? 
10,52,232,ASH,"You do what you want but I'm going win this thing! Chimchar, use Dig, let's go! - "
10,52,233,DAWN,What do we do? - 
10,52,234,CONWAY,No time to worry! For right now we have to deal with Elekid just as we planned! 
10,52,235,DAWN,Right! All right Buizel! Aqua Jet! -

10,52,243,ELEKID,[SURPRISED] - 
10,52,244,ASH,Protect's been smashed! - 
10,52,245,DAWN,Here goes! 
10,52,246,ENTA,What a Feint! And the team of Dawn and Conway makes a perfect combination! Feint is quite effective against opponentsusing Protect or Detect it can actually cause damage against either of those defensive moves. A useful tool indeed. 
10,52,247,BROCK,"This is going to be rough for Paul, since he's always used Protect to avoid att*cks in the past! "

10,52,281,PAUL,So it all starts here! 
10,52,282,DAWN,Is that what I think it is? 
10,52,283,CONWAY,That's right Elekid's beginning to evolve! 
10,52,284,ELECTABUZZ,[APPEARING] 
10,52,285,ENTA,Elekid evolves into Electabuzz before our eyes! - 
10,52,286,DAWN,I've got to see! - 
10,52,287,POKEDEX,"Electabuzz. The Electric Pokémon and evolved form of Elekid. It appears near power generators and because it eats electricity, - it can cause blackouts. - "
10,52,288,PAUL,"Electabuzz, Thunder! "
10,52,289,ENTA,Electabuzz appears to be gathering tremendous power! 
10,52,290,CONWAY,"All right, I think we should att*ck first, just to make sure they don't get the upper hand! - "
10,52,291,DAWN,Right! -

10,52,314,CONWAY,Heracross! 
10,52,315,ENTA,Have Buizel and Heracross reached the end? 
10,52,316,JUDGE,Buizel and Heracross are unable to battle! The winners are Chimchar and Electabuzz! 
10,52,317,ENTA,And there you have it! The victory in this year's Hearthome City Tag Battle Competition goes to Ash and Paul! 
10,52,318,ASH,"Yeah, we did it! We did it! All right! - "
10,52,319,JESSIE,Chimmy's number one! -

10,52,326,CONWAY,"You too, Heracross! You battled really hard right through to the end! "
10,52,327,ASH,"Wow Paul, everything totally changed for the better after your Elekid evolved into Electabuzz you know? "
10,52,328,PAUL,"You're so pathetic! That Flamethrower of Chimchar's should've put Heracross out on the spot, but it was still standing up! If not for Electabuzz's Thunder, we couldn't've won! You two deserve each other just like I said! "
10,52,329,ASH,Talk all you want! Chimchar was awesome. I knew it! And we're just gonna keep getting stronger! 
10,52,330,CHIMCHAR,[HAPPY] 
10,52,331,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
10,52,332,ENTA,"Yes, there were a few scary moments, but I think this Tag Battle challenge has brought out something new, and exciting, in you both! So now I'm pleased to present you each - with a Soothe Bell! - "
10,52,333,ASH,Thank you very much! 
10,52,334,ENTA,And let's also give a big hand to all the other Pokémon who battled so hard during the competition! 
10,52,335,BROCK,"If you ask me, Paul's greatest reward was his Elekid evolving! "
10,52,336,DAWN,"Well don't forget, he only did this so he could power up his Pokémon! "
10,52,337,CONWAY,It's rather ironic that the least well-suited team managed to win the Tag battle! I guess every rule has to have an exception! 
10,52,338,JAMES,Chimchar certainly demonstrated the fight in fighting spirit. A nice end to a nice day! 
10,52,339,MEOWTH,Nice to have a nice end to a nice day! 
10,52,340,JESSIE,"Nice to feel nice about having a nice. Wait, the bell! "
10,52,341,ASH,I just got a Soothe Bell! 
10,52,342,DAWN,That's great Ash! You earned this! 
10,52,343,ASH,"Hey, thanks Dawn! "
10,52,344,DAWN,"It's never fun losing a competition, but we'll win the next one, right? "
10,52,345,BROCK,This was great! A nice change of pace! 
10,52,346,DAWN,No need to worry! It's Paul! - 
10,52,347,ASH,What was that for? - 
10,52,348,PAUL,I have no need for that! 
10,52,349,ASH,Don't mind him! We're a team now! 
10,52,350,CONWAY,"Say, I've got an idea! Why not head to the Veilstone Gym in Veilstone City? "
10,52,351,BROCK,Hey Ash. Isn't Veilstone City where Paul is from? 
10,52,352,ASH,"Yeah! Next stop? It's Veilstone City! And then, I'll get my third Sinnoh Gym badge for sure! "
10,52,353,NARRATOR,"As the Hearthome City Tag Battle competition winds down with all our heroes as skilled participants, Ash claims victory once again, along with a new member of the family! But the Sinnoh excitement is just heating up, so you've got to stay tuned for all the action"
10,51,0,NARRATOR,"The Hearthome City Tag Battle competition was off to a rousing start with Ash, Brock, and Dawn in the fray, when Ash discovered his Tag Battle partner was to be none other than Paul! "
10,51,1,NARRATOR,"Though a complete mismatch at first glance, this most unusual team, along with Pikachu and Chimchar, battled fiercely in spite of their many disagreements to gain a decisive first round victory! "
10,51,2,NARRATOR,"But that was then, and one question remains: What will become of Ash and Paul, now?

10,51,19,NURSE JOY,Thanks! Who are you? 
10,51,20,BROCK,"The name is Brock! Yes, I'm a skilled competitor, but underneath this roughand tumble exterior I'm an aspiring Pokémon Breeder and nice guy who helps Pokémon! "
10,51,21,NURSE JOY,"Well Brock, in that case, I would love for you to help me! "
10,51,22,HOLLY,That Brock sure gets around doesn't he? 
10,51,23,CONWAY,So a Pokémon's potential ability is greatly influenced by the quality of relationship with its Trainer which is evidenced by otherwise unthinkable displays of power in their moves and abilities! 
10,51,24,DAWN,Sounds great! Though I don't have much of a clue what you just said. 
10,51,25,DAWN,"Although it sounded like the better friends Pokémon and Trainers are the stronger they get, right? "
10,51,26,CONWAY,"Yes, precisely! See? You do get it! And, remember this applies to contests, too! "
10,51,27,DAWN,Friendship. That's the key.

10,51,70,ASH,Yes it is! We're a Tag Team! 
10,51,71,PAUL,Your point? 
10,51,72,ASH,I still don't understand why you entered this thing! 
10,51,73,PAUL,You wouldn't!

10,51,82,CHIMCHAR,[SAD] 
10,51,83,ASH,"Paul, if you want to make Chimchar stronger, you got to work on improving its strong points! "
10,51,84,PAUL,"Oh, please! Spending a second improving a Pokémon's strong points is like babying a spoiled brat and a complete waste of my time, see? "

10,50,77,DAWN,Look at that! I guess Ash and Paul could learn a thing from Pikachu! 
10,50,78,PIKACHU,[GRUNT] 
10,50,79,PIKACHU,[YELL] -

10,50,86,ASH,"Wow, you sure are strong these days "
10,50,87,PAUL,Just pathetic. 
10,50,88,ENTA,"In a Tag Battle, the real key to success is to create the spirit of partnership between both Trainers and their Pokémon! To learn to truly rely on each other! And so, to the team that emerges victorious, we will be awarding an item that's sure to deepen the connection between you even more! Our grand prize! "
10,50,89,MEOWTH,Wow! Dig it! Ring a ding! 
10,50,90,JESSIE,"With that in my ear, I could learn to put up with you. "
10,50,91,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE]

10,50,93,ASH,"Whoa, what an awesome first prize! "
10,50,94,DAWN,It sure is! 
10,50,95,JAMES,"Now there's a must have! With that bell tinkling at my beck and call, why I'd be the pied piper of every Pokémon in Sinnoh! "
10,50,96,JAMES,"So! If elected to strategize the stealing of said bell, I promise a pile of pazoozas in every pot! "

10,50,104,ENTA,"All right Trainers! By now you've all found your Tag Battle partners! As you all know, the battle festivities don't commence until this afternoon. So you have until then to practice with your partner! "
10,50,105,CONWAY,"Dawn, you know you're lucky to have been matched with me. "
10,50,106,CONWAY,"You see, after careful analysis of every league battle up to and including the present, I've calculated the proper formula for ensuring that victory is ours. "
10,50,107,DAWN,"That's great, Conway. "
10,50,108,HOLLY,All right! Let's talk strategy! 
10,50,109,BROCK,Okay. 
10,50,110,ENTA,"All right. It's time for our first match! And here are the rules! Each Trainer is allowed to use one Pokémon, with no time limit! There will be no substitutions. Whichever team ends up unable to battle is defeated! Then tomorrow, the winners advance to the second round battles! Now today, our first battle will be A Block!

10,50,157,SLOWKING,[att*ck] 
10,50,158,KOFFING,[GROAN] 
10,50,159,JUDGE,Koffing's unable to battle as well! Which means The winners are Piplup and Slowking! 
10,50,160,ENTA,And the exciting first battle of A Block has been decided!! 
10,50,161,CONWAY,"So, Dawn, how was it? "
10,50,162,DAWN,"Awesome! Our att*ck and defense moves were perfect! Now, I want you to tell me all about this battle formula of yours! I'm sure they'll help me in my contests! "
10,50,163,CONWAY,You're a Coordinator? 
10,50,164,BROCK,"That Conway's very big on defensive moves! Dawn's got herself an interesting partner, that's for sure! "
10,50,165,ASH,"They're unstoppable! You know we should be doing that too, Paul! "
10,50,166,ASH,Hey! What was that for? 
10,50,167,PAUL,Give Chimchar your suggestions! 
10,50,168,ASH,"Chimchar? Wow you've been working on your Flamethrower, haven't you? "
10,50,169,CHIMCHAR,[EXCITED] 
10,50,170,PAUL,A weak Flamethrower from a weak flame! Even though you have no control over it at all! 
10,50,171,CHIMCHAR,[SAD] 
10,50,172,ASH,"I thought it was great! Say, why don't you let us help you out? "
10,50,173,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
10,50,174,PAUL,"Sorry, we don't need your help! "
10,50,175,ASH,"This is a Tag Battle! That means, we work together to win! "
10,50,176,PAUL,"It's all about you, isn't it? "
10,50,177,ASH,What's that? 
10,50,178,ELEKID,[ANGRY] 
10,50,179,DAWN,Sounds like you might've forgotten the purpose of this competition. Fact of the matter is both Trainers and Pokémon have to constantly think about each other in a Tag Battle! 
10,50,180,DAWN,That is what Cynthia said. 
10,50,181,PAUL,"""When every life meets another life, something will be born."" So? Chimchar, let's go! Now! "
10,50,182,ASH,Hey Paul! Why did you enter this thing in the first place? 
10,50,183,PAUL,So I could meet Fire-type Pokémon. - 
10,50,184,ASH,Meet Fire types? - 
10,50,185,BROCK,"I get it! Knowing Paul, that reason makes a lot of sense "
10,50,186,BROCK,Do you remember the very first time Paul and Ash had a battle? 
10,50,187,BROCK,"Back then, Paul used Pikachu's Thunderbolt to power up his Elekid's Thunder! "
10,50,188,BROCK,"This time, it's exactly the same! Paul's planning to use his opponent's Fire att*cks to juice up Chimchar's! "
10,50,189,ASH,"Makes sense, but I sure don't like it "
10,50,190,ENTA,Our fiery first round moves on to the E Block! It's the speedy Wingull and the powerful Sudowoodo against Yanma and Bagon! 
10,50,191,HOLLY,Wingull! Use Blizzard!

10,50,196,BROCK,I think Yanma's going to catch up with that speed!

10,50,208,BOY A,What are you doing? Yanma was doing so well! 
10,50,209,BOY B,"Oh yeah? You'd better counterattack, or we're doomed! "
10,50,210,ASH,This is no place for those guys to fight! 
10,50,211,CONWAY,This has got to be the worst battle of all time! 
10,50,212,BROCK,All right! Let's pull together and win this! 
10,50,213,HOLLY,"Brock, you're right. Wingull, Blizzard! "
10,50,214,WINGULL,[BLIZZARD MOVE]

10,50,221,ENTA,"And using that Blizzard as the perfect opening, Sudowoodo lands a beautiful Flail! "
10,50,222,HOLLY,Aerial Ace! 
10,50,223,WINGULL,[AERIAL ACE MOVE] 
10,50,224,ENTA,"It's Wingull with a super-fast Aerial Ace, and Yanma receives a direct hit! "
10,50,225,JUDGE,Bagon and Yanma are unable to battle! The winners are Wingull and Sudowoodo!! 
10,50,226,HOLLY,We won! 
10,50,227,WINGULL,[EXCITED] 
10,50,228,SUDOWOODO,[PROUD] 
10,50,229,BROCK,Yes! And you're a sensation! Sorry about that. 
10,50,230,HOLLY,"I'm so impressed with the brilliant call you made, and how you well you worked with your Sudowoodo! "
10,50,231,BROCK,Yeah? 
10,50,232,HOLLY,We could be the greatest Tag Team partners the world's ever known! 
10,50,233,CROAGUNK,[CROAKING] 
10,50,234,DAWN,All right! Now Brock's won too! 
10,50,235,ASH,I knew it! Brock and Sudowoodo were great out there! 
10,50,236,ASH,And now it's us. 
10,50,237,ENTA,The time has come for the last of the final first round battles: the H Block! I'm sure that in this case last is certainly not least! 
10,50,238,ASH,"Okay, ready Pikachu? "
10,50,239,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
10,50,240,PAUL,"Chimchar, stand by! "
10,50,241,CHIMCHAR,[APPEARING]

10,50,243,"MAGMAR, RHYDON",[APPEARING] 
10,50,244,MEOWTH,It's Chimchar time! 
10,50,245,JAMES,I've got to get a load of that heat! 
10,50,246,WOBBUFFET,[CURIOUS] 
10,50,247,JESSIE,Keep your eye on the bell! 
10,50,248,ASH,Get ready Paul This could be tough! 
10,50,249,PAUL,With Pikachu? Tough is right.. 
10,50,250,ASH,Chimchar's not such a great match! 
10,50,251,PAUL,"Well, who asked you? "
10,50,252,CONWAY,"I can predict the results. Their opponents are a Fire-type Magmar, and Rhydon who's a Rock and Ground type. The two Fire types' moves won't affect each other much. And Pikachu's Electric-type moves won't damage Rhydon in the least! "
10,50,253,DAWN,And the Trainers' matchups aren't much better! 
10,50,254,ENTA,"Now then, battle begin! "
10,50,255,ASH,"Let's show that Magmar a thing or two! Quick Pikachu, use Thunderbolt! "
10,50,256,PIKACHU,[THUNDERBOLT MOVE] 
10,50,257,ENTA,Amazing! Astonishing! Rhydon absorbed Pikachu's Thunderbolt!! 
10,50,258,RESEARCHER,"Now Rhydon, use Megahorn! "
10,50,259,RHYDON,[MEGAHORN MOVE] 
10,50,260,ASH,Pikachu! 
10,50,261,PAUL,"Don't know Rhydon's special Ability, huh? "
10,50,262,ASH,Ability? You mean? 
10,50,263,DAWN,"What was that, Brock? "
10,50,264,BROCK,Lightning Rod. Rhydon's Ability! Lightning Rod can absorb any Electric-type move! 
10,50,265,DAWN,Does that mean Pikachu can't use any of its Electric-type moves? 
10,50,266,CONWAY,I'm afraid Pikachu's out of commission! 
10,50,267,PAUL,Forget it. You're just in the way! 
10,50,268,ASH,"Give me a break! I don't care what you say. I'm in this Tag Battle too, you know! "
10,50,269,ELITE,"Magmar, use Lava Plume! "
10,50,270,MAGMAR,[LAVA PLUME MOVE] 
10,50,271,PAUL,Look out. 
10,50,272,RHYDON,[IMPACT] 
10,50,273,DAWN,"Rhydon got hit, too! "
10,50,274,BROCK,Lava Plume's a move that hits everyone in the area! But Fire-type moves don't affect Rhydon that much. That was a great strategy! 
10,50,275,PAUL,Chimchar! Let's go! 
10,50,276,PIKACHU,[CAUTIONING] 
10,50,277,ELITE,"Chimchar?! Even if Chimchar is a Fire-type, this much fire's gonna cause major damage! "
10,50,278,ASH,Pikachu! Dodge it quick! 
10,50,279,PIKACHU,[DODGING] 
10,50,280,CHIMCHAR,[BRACING] 
10,50,281,ENTA,And that Lava Plume engulfs Chimchar completely!! 
10,50,282,PAUL,"Chimchar, Flamethrower! "
10,50,283,CHIMCHAR,[FLAMETHROWER MOVE] 
10,50,284,ASH,Awesome! 
10,50,285,BROCK,"Paul's using that Lava Plume to power up Chimchar's Flamethrower, just like I suspected he would! "
10,50,286,RHYDON,[SHIELDING] 
10,50,287,RESEARCHER,"Hammer Arm, go! "

10,50,294,CONWAY,True! Great effect! 
10,50,295,RHYDON,[SHOCKED] / [PAINED] 
10,50,296,RESEARCHER,"Heads up! Though Pikachu may be an Electric-type, we've still got to be careful! "

10,50,299,MAGMAR,[PROTECT MOVE]

10,50,301,BROCK,Look out! That Rhydon knows how to use Surf! 
10,50,302,CONWAY,That's quite a shock! You can be sure that's got to surprise its opponents in a big way! 
10,50,303,RHYDON,[FOCUSED] 
10,50,304,"PIKACHU, CHIMCHAR",[SHOCKED] 
10,50,305,PAUL,"Chimchar! Flame Wheel, let's go! "
10,50,306,ASH,Paul what're you doing? You're going to make us lose! 
10,50,307,DAWN,That's crazy! 
10,50,308,BROCK,Paul's taking a big chance That Surf is serious! 
10,50,309,CHIMCHAR,[FLAME WHEEL MOVE] 
10,50,310,ENTA,"A brave move to battle that Surf with Flame Wheel, but, brave or not, it's foolhardy! "
10,50,311,ASH,"Chimchar, stop! You're gonna get creamed! "
10,50,312,ASH,I've got it! 
10,50,313,ASH,Pikachu! Use Iron Tail!!

10,50,322,JUDGE,Rhydon's unable to battle! 
10,50,323,DAWN,Of course! That's what Zoey did! 
10,50,324,BROCK,Zoey's Double Performance was just the thing to give Ash a bit of real inspiration! Great! 
10,50,325,ASH,"All right! From now on, I'm doing it my way! Now, Pikachu, Volt Tackle! "

10,50,343,DAWN,"Wow. I'm glad they won, but it certainly wasn't the greatest example of teamwork I've ever seen! "
10,50,344,CONWAY,Well my analysis is telling me their win was the net result of excellent separate efforts! 
10,50,345,BROCK,"I'll say this: it worked today, but that may be it! "
10,50,346,PAUL,"Look, from now on stay out of my face! "
10,50,347,ASH,Get off it! Face it! We work as a team! That's what Tag Battle partners do!

10,49,19,KRICKETUNE,[GREETING] 
10,49,20,DAWN,Nando! 
10,49,21,NANDO,How nice to see you again! 
10,49,22,BROCK,"You here for a Gym battle, too? "
10,49,23,NANDO,"Yes and I thought this time, I would team up with my beloved Kricketune. "
10,49,24,ASH,"Hey, nice to meet you, Kricketune! "
10,49,25,POKEDEX,"Kricketune. The Cricket Pokémon, and the evolved form of Kricketot. It conveys its many emotions with the melodies it composes. "
10,49,26,KRICKETUNE,[PROUD] - 
10,49,27,ASH,Wow! - 
10,49,28,DAWN,"Yeah, a musical Pokémon sounds like a perfect match for you! "
10,49,29,NANDO,"You're very kind. Sadly, it doesn't appear we'll get a chance to battle yet "
10,49,30,DAWN,What? What'll we do? 
10,49,31,BROCK,There's a note on the door 
10,49,32,NANDO,"The note says, ""I regret that I'm going on a journey for quite a long while. And don't look for me."" "
10,49,33,DAWN,That's kind of weird for a Gym Leader 
10,49,34,ASH,"Man, that's just great! After all of this, I feel like I'm going to explode! "
10,49,35,NANDO,Perhaps entering the Hearthome Tag Battle would be some help 
10,49,36,ASH,What's the Hearthome Tag Battle? 
10,49,37,NANDO,Only the most famous competition in Hearthome City! It's where Trainers from all over the world gather to compete in a challenging Tag Battle that will decide who reigns supreme! 
10,49,38,ASH,"You know, sounds like fun! So let's do it! Hey, guys, are you with me? "
10,49,39,ASH,"And Brock, how about you? You and I would really clean up! "
10,49,40,BROCK,"I'm in, Ash! I could use a good battle! "
10,49,41,NANDO,Then you can both register at Hearthome Stadium 
10,49,42,ASH,"Nando, you going to enter? "
10,49,43,NANDO,"No, Ash. We have decided to concentrate on the Pokémon Contest this time "
10,49,44,DAWN,Oh no! I forgot to register again! 
10,49,45,DAWN,Nando? Have you won any more ribbons since I saw you? 
10,49,46,NANDO,"I still find myself with but one contest ribbon and one Gym badge. What about you, Miss Dawn? "
10,49,47,DAWN,"I only have one ribbon, too. Tomorrow will be my first contest in a while! "
10,49,48,NANDO,You must be quite excited! 
10,49,49,DAWN,"I sure am! It'll be my first Double Performance, but thanks to a good friend's help, I can use combinations! "
10,49,50,NANDO,"Oh, sounds like a great friend "
10,49,51,SHELLOS,[CONTENT] 
10,49,52,DAWN,There's the friend I was telling you about! 
10,49,53,DAWN,Zoey! 
10,49,54,PIPLUP,[GREETING] 
10,49,55,ZOEY,"Dawn, you made it! - "
10,49,56,DAWN,Is your leg all healed? - 
10,49,57,ZOEY,It's as good as new! - 
10,49,58,DAWN,"Wow, that's great news! - "
10,49,59,ZOEY,"Dawn, who's that? "
10,49,60,NANDO,"Hello, my name is Nando, Pokémon bard, at your service! It was after meeting Dawn and her friends that I decided to take part in both Gym Battles and Pokémon Contests. - "
10,49,61,ZOEY,"Oh, really? - "
10,49,62,NANDO,Indeed. It's an honor to be able to participate in both events. 
10,49,63,DAWN,"Nando's quite a busy person, uh "
10,49,64,ZOEY,Who really needs to make up his mind! 
10,49,65,NANDO,"My Pokémon guide me. That is the wise way. Do you not agree, then? "
10,49,66,JESSIE [JESSILINA],Here goes! We're off to the races! That's right! Dance the dance of victory! 
10,49,67,MEOWTH,Those two Pokémon look too happy for their own good!

10,49,70,"SEVIPER, DUSTOX",[EXCITED] 
10,49,71,JESSIE,"All right, cut the lovefest. You're both fired. "
10,49,72,MEOWTH,Ain't that a bit brusque? 
10,49,73,JESSIE,It's time for those two to pay for my loss to that redheaded hustler! 
10,49,74,"SEVIPER, DUSTOX",[SHOCKED] 
10,49,75,JAMES,There goes job security! 
10,49,76,MIME JR.,[WORRIED] 
10,49,77,JESSIE,That's it! I'll use Mime Jr.! 
10,49,78,JESSIE,Come on! We go together like a ball and chain! 
10,49,79,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,49,80,JAMES,And I know which is which! 
10,49,81,MEOWTH,"She needs more than one Pokémon, right? "
10,49,82,JESSIE,"So I'll un-fire one, and they'll like it! "
10,49,83,"JAMES, MEOWTH, WOBBUFFET",[SHOCKED] 
10,49,84,DAWN,"All right, Piplup, check! "

10,49,94,BROCK,"You've really come a long way, Dawn! But I would imagine you're feeling a little bit nervous "
10,49,95,DAWN,"Uh, I'm feeling a lot bit nervous! My heart feels like it's racing at about a hundred miles a second! After all, it's my first Double Performance "
10,49,96,ZOEY,And it's all happening tomorrow! - 
10,49,97,DAWN,"Hi, Zoey! - "
10,49,98,ASH,Hey! Long time no see! 
10,49,99,ZOEY,"I heard about the Hearthome Gym thing. - I'm really sorry, Ash! - "
10,49,100,ASH,It was a drag at first! But Brock and I are entering the Hearthome Tag Battle. That'll be a blast! 
10,49,101,ZOEY,Oh yeah? That should be fun! 
10,49,102,ASH,"Thanks! I hope you do great tomorrow, too! "
10,49,103,ZOEY,"Of course, if I win tomorrow, that means Dawn won't "
10,49,104,ASH,"Let's say I'm rooting for the both of you, okay? "
10,49,105,DAWN,"Oh, I almost forgot! Thanks to all the great advice you gave me about Double Performances, I know I'll look great! "
10,49,106,ZOEY,You know you'll look great? 
10,49,107,DAWN,"I can't wait! You've taught me so much about contests, Zoey! "
10,49,108,ZOEY,"I think your priorities are a little messed up. The Pokémon is the star, not the Coordinator! "
10,49,109,ZOEY,Make sure you focus on your Pokémon! 
10,49,110,DAWN,"Okay. Thanks, I will! "
10,49,111,ZOEY,And you all have a great time tomorrow!

10,49,118,DAWN,Of course! No need to worry! 
10,49,119,ZOEY,Worried about other Coordinators? You don't sound very confident 
10,49,120,JESSIE,Au contraire! I'm confidence queen! 
10,49,121,NANDO,Dear me the sparks are sure flying! 
10,49,122,MARIAN,"Here it is! The Hearthome Ribbon, which one lucky and talented Coordinator will take home, as well as the big chance to move on to the Grand Festival! What do you think of that? And now it's time to hear a few words from our panel of judges! "

10,49,181,JESSIE,"All right, Cacnea, use Needle Arm! Mimic, Mime Jr.! "
10,49,182,JESSIE,"Mime Jr., Tickle, please! "

10,49,185,MARIAN,"This is a ticklish situation! A surprising combination, where Cacnea joins forces with Mime Jr.'s unpredictable Tickle move! "
10,49,186,JESSIE,I never thought being ticklish was a plus! 
10,49,187,JAMES,I think Jessie's found true genius in spite of herself! 
10,49,188,MEOWTH,"You know, being a complete nutcase like that can't be faked! "

10,49,218,GLAMEOW,[EXCITED] 
10,49,219,ASH,They split that Water Pulse in two! 
10,49,220,BROCK,And the sole purpose of that whole thingwas to make both of her Pokémon shine All I can say is well done! 
10,49,221,CONTESTA,Glameow and Shellos's sharp and bold movements had me riveted in my seat and held me transfixed until the dramatic big finish!

10,49,238,DAWN,Yeah!

10,49,252,ZOEY,Dawn - 
10,49,253,DAWN,It's fine. You don't have to say anything. 
10,49,254,PIPLUP,[CONCERNED] 
10,49,255,DAWN,I said it's fine! - 
10,49,256,DAWN,I'm sorry -

10,49,274,MARIAN,We've got five minutes on the clock! Let's go! 
10,49,275,JOHANNA,Dawn must feel pretty bad 
10,49,276,ASH,"Yeah. Zoey does, too! But they have each other to talk about stuff with "
10,49,277,JOHANNA,Poor Zoey. She got so close to winning the whole thing. 
10,49,278,BROCK,Do you want us to go get Dawn? 
10,49,279,JOHANNA,I think it's best if I leave her alone right now. I know she'll be fine! 
10,49,280,JOHANNA,"You see, having a friend instead of me to talk to is the best thing for her! "
10,49,281,ZOEY,"That Nando is sure something else, you know? "
10,49,282,ZOEY,"The way he's chosen to compete in contests and Gym battles. It's like he knows it's his destiny! I could never do that, I'll tell you "
10,49,283,DAWN,"Well, at least you didn't lose in the first round, now, did you? - "
10,49,284,ZOEY,Will you cut that out? - 
10,49,285,DAWN,Sorry. 
10,49,286,ZOEY,"I was afraid I wasn't going to make it past the first round, too, you know. When that happens, I know what to do! I just hug my Pokémon! And that makes me feel a lot better! "
10,49,287,DAWN,You know what? You're pretty smart. 
10,49,288,ZOEY,"Today was a great experience for me! When I saw Nando and his Pokémon do all those amazing things, it made me just want to work that much harder! - "
10,49,289,DAWN,I guess you're right. - 
10,49,290,ZOEY,No need to worry? 
10,49,291,DAWN,It's a deal! No need to worry!

10,47,36,MEOWTH,"It's that Abra! All they did was grab onto it, and it was off to the races! Heh! "
10,47,37,JESSIE,"Sounds like we need to grab onto it, too! "
10,47,38,MEOWTH,Now you're talking! 
10,47,39,JAMES,"Of course! You see, if that Abra was ours, our blasting-off days would be over for good! "
10,47,40,JESSIE,"He's right! Whenever a blastoff was in progress, we'd just teleport to somewhere safe and sound! - "

10,47,49,ASH,I don't think they'd put Hearthome City on a dam. 
10,47,50,MIRA,"Oh dear, I guess we made a mistake! "
10,47,51,MIRA,Sorry about that! 
10,47,52,BROCK,"Oh well. I guess we all make mistakes, don't we? "
10,47,53,DAWN,"Yeah, so now can we try again? "
10,47,54,MIRA,Hold on. I need to ask you a favor. 
10,47,55,ASH,A favor? 
10,47,56,MIRA,"See, a while back I dropped my grandmother's beautiful pendant into the lake down there. And so "
10,47,57,BROCK,I get it! So you thought you'd ask us if we'd help you to get your pendant back! 
10,47,58,DAWN,"That means you teleported us here on purpose, right? "
10,47,59,MIRA,I'm sorry! 
10,47,60,ASH,"Wow well, what do you know. "
10,47,61,DAWN,But wouldn't it just be easier to look for it by using Abra's power to teleport? 
10,47,62,MIRA,"Yeah, but the thing is, Abra can't teleport underwater. Big problem! "
10,47,63,ASH,"So that's that! First we'll help you find the pendant, and then you can help us! - "
10,47,64,DAWN,"I'd like to help, too! - "
10,47,65,BROCK,Count me in! 
10,47,66,MIRA,Thanks so much! I'm sure your Piplup and Buizel will be a big help as well! 
10,47,67,DAWN,But how did you know about them? 
10,47,68,MIRA,I saw you with them in the river back there. 
10,47,69,ASH,You did? You've had this planned out from the start! 
10,47,70,BROCK,"Well I guess that's okay. But look around! This lake is huge and deep, too! There's no way we could ever search the whole thing! "
10,47,71,MIRA,"Hey, no problem! I've got everything under control! "
10,47,72,MIRA,With these... 
10,47,73,MIRA,You'll be able to stay underwater a long time! -

10,47,86,ASH,"Whoa... I'll tell you, I never thought we'd run into a Gyarados down there! "
10,47,87,DAWN,"Mira, you knew about that Gyarados, right? "
10,47,88,MIRA,"Of course! But if I had told you about it, you wouldn't have come with me! "
10,47,89,BROCK,So what else? 
10,47,90,BROCK,It's time for you to tell us what else you've been hiding! 
10,47,91,ASH,"What do you mean, Brock? "
10,47,92,BROCK,You brought us like you already knew the way! 
10,47,93,BROCK,You took us right to where Gyarados was! 
10,47,94,BROCK,It's like you were looking for something. Something in that exact location! 
10,47,95,BROCK,That's no accident. 
10,47,96,BROCK,"Thing is, you've already narrowed your search down to such a small area, I don't understand what you need us for! "
10,47,97,MIRA,I guess they're not psychic! 
10,47,98,ABRA,[AGREEMENT] 
10,47,99,MIRA,I'm sorry. I made up the pendant story! - 
10,47,100,DAWN,What?! - 
10,47,101,ASH,Why do a thing like that? 
10,47,102,MIRA,You know the building we found Gyarados in? That's the school I used to go to! 
10,47,103,MIRA,"When I was there, I had two of the best friends in the whole wide world! "
10,47,104,MIRA,"We played together all the time! On the playground, and the gym, and everywhere! "
10,47,105,MIRA,"One day, we found a Poké Ball, and there was a Pokémon already in it! "
10,47,106,MIRA,"We decided right away it was going to belong to all three of us, and we all raised it! "
10,47,107,MIRA,"See, we were all working hard to become Trainers "
10,47,108,MIRA,So we took turns bringing it to each of our houses and taking care of it! 
10,47,109,MIRA,"But one day, some people we didn't know said they were building a dam that would put our town underwater! We all had to move, and my friends went to a different town. "
10,47,110,ASH,"Wow, too bad. "
10,47,111,DAWN,"So, do you have any idea what happened to the Poké Ball? "
10,47,112,MIRA,"Not sure. I even called up my friends who moved away, and they had no idea either! "
10,47,113,BROCK,"Well, it has to be somewhere! "
10,47,114,MIRA,"Thing is, I really think I do know! The three of us had a secret hiding place. "
10,47,115,MIRA,I can't tell you how many times I've tried to go back down there with Abra. 
10,47,116,MIRA,"But we can never get past you-know-who. That nasty Gyarados always chases us away! We've tried to fight back before, but Abra's water battling skills aren't so good! "
10,47,117,ABRA,[EMBARRASSED] 
10,47,118,DAWN,"Well, now at least I can understand why you wanted us to help you! "
10,47,119,ASH,But why didn't you tell the truth from the start? 
10,47,120,MIRA,"I couldn't! Here I am working to be a Pokémon Trainer, and at the same time I've totally neglected the Pokémon I loved and took care of for such a long time! "
10,47,121,BROCK,"Yeah, I guess it would be pretty hard to admit that. "
10,47,122,DAWN,"So what kind of Pokémon is inside that Poké Ball, anyway? "
10,47,123,MIRA,"Sandshrew! But Sandshrew are Ground types and weak against water, so I'm worried about it. "
10,47,124,BROCK,"As long as it stays in its Poké Ball, I'm sure that it'll be just fine! "
10,47,125,ASH,Great! So let's all go and save that Sandshrew! 
10,47,126,BROCK,Yeah! 
10,47,127,DAWN,And battling in the water will be good training for Piplup and Buizel! 
10,47,128,MIRA,Thanks so much! That's awesome! 
10,47,129,ABRA,[AGREEMENT] 
10,47,130,ASH,"But if we're gonna be taking on that Gyarados, we really need to plan out a strategy. "
10,47,131,DAWN,That Gyarados looks angry and strong. 
10,47,132,BROCK,So? I've got a plan! 
10,47,133,BROCK,Now don't you worry about a thing! 
10,47,134,JESSIE,What are those Twerps doing here? 
10,47,135,JAMES,It is a bit too moist for Hearthome City. 
10,47,136,MEOWTH,Maybe that Abra's radar got knocked out of whack. 
10,47,137,JAMES,That dive was no accident! 
10,47,138,JESSIE,I'll bet they're looking for something down there! 
10,47,139,MEOWTH,"Lakes are notorious for having pirate treasures stuck in them, you know? "
10,47,140,JAMES,"Sorry to be a wet blanket, but lakes with dams can't be accessed by pirate ships. "
10,47,141,JESSIE,"Oh, you and your dumb details! "
10,47,142,JESSIE,Abra's hers but very soon Abra will be ours!

10,46,25,ASH,What makes you think that? 
10,46,26,DAWN,"You're right, which means we've got no time to talk! "
10,46,27,JESSIE,"Well, if you stopped talking, you'd realize you could take a shortcut right through this cave here! "
10,46,28,DAWN,Really? 
10,46,29,JAMES,"True, though at cave's end there is a bit of a maze to deal with. "
10,46,30,JAMES,"Although, with the aid of this map, said maze may be most conveniently managed! "

10,46,41,MEOWTH,"Hey, Pikachu! "

10,46,54,JAMES,The whole community of Rock types certainly has expanded!

10,46,56,JAMES,"Ooh, listen to you! "
10,46,57,DAWN,"Man, I sure wish I could read this map better. "

10,44,97,RHONDA,Great hearing. 
10,44,98,RHONDA,"Hippopotas like to live in dry places and cover themselves in sand, too. They usually travel together as a herd with the change of season, searching for the dry places they love. We were filming that very event when this came up! When we found this one got separated from the herd, we thought this a much better story! "
10,44,99,ASH,"And now everything's okay, right? "

10,44,131,JAMES,It's Hippopotas! 
10,44,132,JESSIE,"Next you'll say, ""Let's give it to the Boss as a present!"" "
10,44,133,JAMES,Right! Picture this! The Boss is on the links playing  holes or so when he suddenly shanks it and lobs it right into a sand trap! But guess who's waiting in said sand to lob it out with nose blowback? 
10,44,134,JAMES,Right on the green for an easy birdie! 
10,44,135,JAMES,And what would His Bossness say then? 
10,44,136,JAMES,"""Ahh, just like Hippopotas to keep me under par!"" Har har. Perhaps it would be less technical to picture the Boss on the beach! "
10,44,137,JAMES,"But as fate would have it, it's sorely lacking in sand! Well, if it's sand in demand, who more able than Hippopotas to hustle up enough sand for a thousand Bosses to play in? Then guess his very next utterance? ""Who better than Hippopotas for a turn down beach day?"" Yay! "

10,44,143,DAWN,Aww. Brock's sleepy. 
10,44,144,ASH,"Brock? Man, this is no time for a nap, so come on! Let's move it! "
10,44,145,DAWN,"But Ash, there's nothing we can really do, since he was hit by Hippopotas's Yawn back there. "
10,44,146,ASH,"Yeah, you're right. With Brock like this, we can't go anywhere. "
10,44,147,DAWN,What a mess. 
10,44,148,ASH,I give up. Let's take a break.

10,44,162,RHONDA,Who asked you anyway? Move! 
10,44,163,BROCK,"It's so embarrassing But thanks, guys, for getting me out of there. "
10,44,164,ASH,"Hey, it was Croagunk that saved you. "
10,44,165,BROCK,It was Croagunk?

10,42,44,JACO,I just love Flying-type Pokémon! Compared to Electric types.

10,42,65,DAWN,You mean it? 
10,42,66,CAL,Long as you don't mind things being a bit quiet. 
10,42,67,ASH,Whoa. So where are the Electric types? 
10,42,68,DAWN,I don't see anybody. 
10,42,69,CAL,I told you so. All the others have finished with their training and graduated. 
10,42,70,CAL,"Of course, this Electrike will do the same and then move on to the Power Generating Room. "
10,42,71,DAWN,What goes on in there? 
10,42,72,BROCK,"First you train them to use their lightning abilities, then they help you generate electricity, correct? "
10,42,73,CAL,"That's right. But in order to do that, they must have complete control over all their Electric-type moves, which is why they train here first. "
10,42,74,ASH,Good idea. 
10,42,75,CAL,So now we'll show you the results of their training.

10,42,107,JACO,"Look, it lost control during the last training session and caused you guys all sorts of trouble. "
10,42,108,JACO,"I know the boss tells me it'll all work out, but I'm the one specializing in Flying-type Pokémon breeding, right? "
10,42,109,DAWN,"Well, that's what you said. "
10,42,110,JACO,"Right! But even so, I'm now in a place that specializes in Electric-type Pokémon. "
10,42,111,JACO,The worst! 
10,42,112,BROCK,May I take a closer look at your Electrike?

10,42,119,BROCK,"Hey, all you can do is your best. I'd like to help, too! "
10,42,120,BROCK,"That is, if we could stay here for a bit. "
10,42,121,ASH,"No problem, Brock! "
10,42,122,DAWN,I figured you'd offer to help out! 
10,42,123,BROCK,"Thanks, you guys! What do you say, Electrike? "
10,42,124,ELECTRIKE,[EXCITED] 
10,42,125,JACO,"Well, I'll give it my best sh*t, and with your help, who knows what we can accomplish? "
10,42,126,JESSIE,Ooh! A Training Center Pokémon should make for an excellent recruit! 
10,42,127,JESSIE,Especially when that recruit gets ripped off! 
10,42,128,MEOWTH,But that Electrike's got issues! 
10,42,129,JESSIE,Not for long! Leave it to the Twerps to smooth out the rough spots. 
10,42,130,JAMES,But that could take eons. 
10,42,131,JESSIE,All bad things come to those who wait. 
10,42,132,"JAMES, MEOWTH",Like us for you? 
10,42,133,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,42,134,BROCK,"Electrike stores up electricity in its fur, so it's good to brush that fur all the time! "
10,42,135,JACO,Just like this! 
10,42,136,ASH,Major jolt! 
10,42,137,JACO,What was that? 
10,42,138,DAWN,Must be the brush! 
10,42,139,JACO,What do you mean? 
10,42,140,BROCK,"Use a brush that's not made out of metal! Metal brushes conduct electricity, you see. "
10,42,141,JACO,Right 
10,42,142,BROCK,First thing you want to do is relax Electrikelike this! 
10,42,143,ELECTRIKE,[PURRING] 
10,42,144,BROCK,"Then you have to trust Electrike, and doing that will teach it to trust you right back. "
10,42,145,BROCK,It's really just the same as raising Flying-type Pokémon. 
10,42,146,JACO,I guess you're right! The problem with Electrike is I haven't really had any faith. 
10,42,147,ASH,"Man, you talk like Professor Oak, Brock! "
10,42,148,DAWN,Ash is right. 
10,42,149,ELECTRIKE,[SLEEPING] 
10,42,150,ASH,Electrike's gonna be fine. 
10,42,151,JACO,"All right, Electrike, ready for some training? "
10,42,152,ELECTRIKE,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,42,153,JACO,Let's start with Charge! 
10,42,154,ELECTRIKE,[CHARGE MOVE] 
10,42,155,JACO,Now Thunderbolt! 
10,42,156,ELECTRIKE,[THUNDERBOLT MOVE] 
10,42,157,PIKACHU,[SHOCKED] - 
10,42,158,DAWN,Ash! - 
10,42,159,JACO,Electrike! Stop! 
10,42,160,ELECTRIKE,[CONFUSED] 
10,42,161,PIKACHU,[CONCERNED] 
10,42,162,DAWN,You okay? 
10,42,163,ASH,What's with me and Thunderbolts? 
10,42,164,ELECTRIKE,[ASHAMED] 
10,42,165,JACO,What went wrong now? 
10,42,166,BROCK,The problem was in the timing! 
10,42,167,JACO,What do you mean by that? 
10,42,168,BROCK,"Hey, Ash and Dawn, what do you say we show him? "
10,42,169,ASH,Sure! 
10,42,170,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
10,42,171,DAWN,This ought to be fun! 
10,42,172,PIKACHU,[DETERMINED] 
10,42,173,PACHIRISU,[DETERMINED] 
10,42,174,ASH,Store up your electricity! 
10,42,175,DAWN,Both of you! 
10,42,176,"PIKACHU, PACHIRISU",[FOCUSED] 
10,42,177,ASH,Pikachu! Thunderbolt!

10,42,182,ELECTRIKE,[IMPRESSED] 
10,42,183,DAWN,"Pachirisu, ready to go? "
10,42,184,PACHIRISU,[DISCHARGE MOVE] 
10,42,185,"ASH, PIKACHU",[ALARMED] 
10,42,186,ASH,Somebody's out to get me! 
10,42,187,DAWN,"No, Pachirisu! Stop! "
10,42,188,PACHIRISU,[CONFUSED] 
10,42,189,DAWN,Let's try it again! Here's a Poffin! 
10,42,190,PACHIRISU,[HAPPY] 
10,42,191,JACO,Poffin? 
10,42,192,BROCK,They're Pachirisu's favorite thing to eat! Things should go much better this time around. 
10,42,193,DAWN,"Now store it up, one more time! "
10,42,194,PACHIRISU,[FOCUSED] 
10,42,195,DAWN,"All right, let's go! "
10,42,196,PACHIRISU,[DISCHARGE MOVE] 
10,42,197,DAWN,Perfect! 
10,42,198,PACHIRISU,[JOYFUL] 
10,42,199,JACO,Wow! Right in the middle! 
10,42,200,ELECTRIKE,[IMPRESSED] 
10,42,201,BROCK,The best timing for storing and f*ring electricity depends on each Pokémon. 
10,42,202,JACO,That makes sense to me. 
10,42,203,BROCK,And Electrike's not doomed to fail. I'm sure of that! 
10,42,204,"JACO, ELECTRIKE",[CURIOUS] 
10,42,205,BROCK,"In fact, I'd say Electrike has more power than a normal Electrike does! "
10,42,206,JACO,"Huh, really? More power than normal? "
10,42,207,ELECTRIKE,[SURPRISED] 
10,42,208,ASH,You really think so? 
10,42,209,DAWN,"You know, maybe it had trouble because of excess power! "
10,42,210,BROCK,Right! 
10,42,211,JACO,"So that means all I have to do is figure out what Electrike's perfect timing is, and we're all set! "
10,42,212,BROCK,That's all you need. 
10,42,213,JACO,"Yeah, that's great! "
10,42,214,JACO,"Okay, Electrike, let's get back to training! "
10,42,215,ELECTRIKE,[EXCITED] 
10,42,216,JAMES,Look! That didn't take long. 
10,42,217,MEOWTH,"Hey, waiting's easy! "
10,42,218,JESSIE,Oh yeah? Whoever said that's an idiot! 
10,42,219,MEOWTH,But bad things come to those who wait. 
10,42,220,JESSIE,"Well, you two just wait, because very soon, all sorts of bad things are coming to you! "
10,42,221,JACO,"Wow, you're still up? "
10,42,222,BROCK,"Oh, I'm just whipping up a little bit of foodfor Pikachu, that's all! "
10,42,223,JACO,"A little? Brock, you made all of this? "
10,42,224,BROCK,Different food for different Pokémon. And we've got lots! 
10,42,225,JACO,But even so... 
10,42,226,BROCK,It takes lots of time and care if you want to raise Pokémon that are strong. 
10,42,227,BROCK,"And of course, that's our main job as breeders! "

10,42,246,JAMES,You know what? They sure know how to act like a team. 
10,42,247,MEOWTH,They sure do! Kind of puts a lump in my Pokémonic throat. 
10,42,248,JAMES,"Yeah! My throat, too! "
10,42,249,MEOWTH,That's the way a real team should be! 
10,42,250,JESSIE,Touching. 
10,42,251,JESSIE,Though I think you're touched in the head. 
10,42,252,JAMES,You would think that! 
10,42,253,MEOWTH,We could learn a thing or two from them! 
10,42,254,JESSIE,Don't fall for that gobbledygook! 
10,42,255,JAMES,"Oh, now I understand! "
10,42,256,MEOWTH,"You don't help friends out like that, so no one can. "
10,42,257,JESSIE,Cut the psychology! 
10,42,258,JESSIE,I want Electrike right now! 
10,42,259,JAMES,Aren't you being hasty? 
10,42,260,MEOWTH,They're not done yet!

10,42,321,ASH,"Wow, Jaco's really turned things around. "
10,42,322,DAWN,Hard to believe at first he didn't know anything about Electric-type Pokémon.

10,42,378,MEOWTH,It's that evolving thing.

10,42,394,JAMES,I realize catching Pikachu is the culmination of years of work. 
10,42,395,MEOWTH,But we've also got to consider the friendships we've created with all these Twerps. 
10,42,396,JAMES,No contest! - 
10,42,397,JAMES,"Ready, Meowth? - "
10,42,398,MEOWTH,Watch your hair! -

10,41,117,DAWN,Hold on. double performance? 
10,41,118,ZOEY,"Uh oh, you don't know! "
10,41,119,ZOEY,It couldn't hurt if you checked out the contest's website. Here! 
10,41,120,MARIAN,"Now, the first stage of the Hearthome Pokémon Contest is a double performance.! "
10,41,121,MARIAN,.and the second stage is a double battle! Coordinators who successfully complete the double performance go here! 
10,41,122,MARIAN,"Marvel at the grand scale performance of the world's top coordinators! First up, It's Feraligator's Aqua Tail in action! "
10,41,123,MARIAN,Now watch as it lifts Jigglypuff right up in the air! 
10,41,124,MARIAN,Then Jigglypuff fires off a powerful Psychic att*ck! 
10,41,125,MARIAN,A classic example of how two Pokémon work together to create a magical performance! 
10,41,126,DAWN,Makes sense. 'Course the name says it all. 
10,41,127,ASH,So it's two Pokémon right from the first stage. 
10,41,128,ZOEY,The same exact rules for the Hearthome Contest as for the Grand Festival! 
10,41,129,BROCK,"Well, you haven't exactly trained for this, have you, Dawn? "
10,41,130,ZOEY,I'll help! There's no time like the present.

10,41,137,"GLAMEOW, SHELLOS",[AFFIRMATIVE]

10,41,141,SHELLOS,[MUD b*mb MOVE]

10,41,145,DAWN,Now look at that.! 
10,41,146,ASH,Shockwave charged the Mud b*mb! 
10,41,147,BROCK,A Ground-type att*ck matched up against an Electric-type should be the worst! 
10,41,148,BROCK,But in this situation they're not battling each other. 
10,41,149,ZOEY,Right! It's because of that that it works so well! 
10,41,150,ZOEY,Shellos use Hidden Power now! 
10,41,151,SHELLOS,[HIDDEN POWER MOVE] 
10,41,152,SHELLOS,[EXERTION] 
10,41,153,"GLAMEOW, SHELLOS",[PLEASED]

10,41,156,ASH,That was awesome.! 
10,41,157,BROCK,I see. You used the intensity of that whole performance to highlight your Glameow's beauty at the very end! 
10,41,158,ZOEY,"Right, Brock! That way I can really make my Pokémon shine! "
10,41,159,DAWN,"So, points come from the end? "
10,41,160,ZOEY,It's more than that. 
10,41,161,ZOEY,"There's move balancing between two Pokémon, and which order do you present them in? "
10,41,162,ZOEY,"Do you show them one at a time, or both together? "
10,41,163,ZOEY,And what's the best way to get them to pose after they've completed their moves? 
10,41,164,ZOEY,"Not to mention, which capsule seal is the most effective seal? "
10,41,165,DAWN,Oh man. Lots to think about. 
10,41,166,ZOEY,"Yeah, the double performance is more difficult, no doubt about it. "
10,41,167,DAWN,"It's tough enough figuring out how to make just one Pokémon look good! You said you were still training, but you sure looked amazing to me! - "
10,41,168,ZOEY,Long way to go. - 
10,41,169,DAWN,But why? 
10,41,170,ZOEY,Glameow and Shellos should be able to shine much more. 
10,41,171,ZOEY,But I still haven't come up with how to really bring that out just yet. 
10,41,172,DAWN,Oh. I see. 
10,41,173,ASH,"Whoa, that's tough! "
10,41,174,ZOEY,"If you want to improve, you can never be satisfied with where you are now. It's the same with gym battles right? "
10,41,175,ASH,"Yeah, you bet! "
10,41,176,DAWN,"Wow, that's just what my mom told me when I won my first ribbon! "
10,41,177,ZOEY,Your mom?! 
10,41,178,BROCK,"Oh yeah, Dawn's mom was a top coordinator in her day! "
10,41,179,ZOEY,Really! Now that's got to be challenging at times. 
10,41,180,DAWN,A little. But all I can do is try to be me! 
10,41,181,DAWN,And right now being me means working on all of those double performance skills! 
10,41,182,DAWN,And we're gonna blow them away! 
10,41,183,"PIPLUP, PACHIRISU, BUNEARY, BUIZEL",[EXCITED] 
10,41,184,JAMES,So now it's double performance. 
10,41,185,MEOWTH,It sounds like twice the hassle! 
10,41,186,JESSIE,Not at all! 
10,41,187,JAMES,Not at all what? 
10,41,188,JESSIE,"A double performance is using two Pokémon! Well, we do that all the time! "
10,41,189,JESSIE,It might be a Seviper and Cacnea combo. 
10,41,190,JESSIE,.or perhaps a Carnivine and Dustox duo! 
10,41,191,JESSIE,Not to mention a total Twerp as*ault which brings everybody to the fore! 
10,41,192,JAMES,That doesn't mean we're any good at it. 
10,41,193,JESSIE,Perhaps I should win that contest just to prove my point! 
10,41,194,MEOWTH,Don't tell me we're going through that again. 
10,41,195,JESSIE,Go through what?! 
10,41,196,"JAMES, MEOWTH",Watching you win of course! 
10,41,197,JESSIE,"So, let's prepare for my blast off into the world of win! "
10,41,198,MEOWTH,That's not the blast off I'm worried about.

10,41,238,DAWN,You're right. nothing's working. 
10,41,239,ASH,"Hey, I know! Do some Contest Battle training for a change! "
10,41,240,DAWN,"Yeah, you think so? "
10,41,241,BROCK,Great idea! You might come up with some good combinations in the process! 
10,41,242,ZOEY,"Yeah, and that could help you with your Double Performance as well! "
10,41,243,DAWN,Right! Okay I'll give it a try!

10,40,165,POKEDEX,Torterra. The Continent Pokémon. Torterra is the final evolved form of Turtwig. Sometimes small Pokémon will gather to make their nests on Torterra's back. 
10,40,166,BROCK,Paul's got three Pokémon to go. 
10,40,167,DAWN,While Cynthia's still got all six of her Pokémon ready! 
10,40,168,DAWN,And Garchomp's hardly even gotten a scratch! 
10,40,169,PAUL,Giga Drain! 
10,40,170,TORTERRA,[GIGA DRAIN MOVE] 
10,40,171,GARCHOMP,[PAINED] 
10,40,172,ASH,A hit! 
10,40,173,PIKACHU,[SURPRISED] 
10,40,174,DAWN,But I don't understand why Garchomp didn't even try to dodge it! 
10,40,175,BROCK,Of course! That's what Paul wanted to happen! 
10,40,176,BROCK,"After a Giga Impact is launched, it takes a while to recharge. "
10,40,177,BROCK,"So Paul knew that by using Giga Drain at this moment, he could sap Garchomp's power for just long enough, until Giga Impact could be fully charged up and Garchomp could use it again! "
10,40,178,PAUL,Giga Impact is a powerful move all right. 
10,40,179,PAUL,.but it's also one of Garchomp's weak points as well! 
10,40,180,TORTERRA,[GIGA DRAIN MOVE] 
10,40,181,GARCHOMP,[WEAK] 
10,40,182,PAUL,Now use Frenzy Plant! 
10,40,183,TORTERRA,[FRENZY PLANT MOVE] 
10,40,184,GARCHOMP,[DETERMINED] 
10,40,185,CYNTHIA,Use Brick Break! 
10,40,186,GARCHOMP,[BRICK BREAK MOVE] 
10,40,187,TORTERRA,[SURPRISED] 
10,40,188,GARCHOMP,[BRICK BREAK MOVE] 
10,40,189,GARCHOMP,[BRICK BREAK MOVE][PAINED] 
10,40,190,ASH,What.can you say? 
10,40,191,ASH,She's the Champion! 
10,40,192,PAUL,I guess that's it. 
10,40,193,CYNTHIA,"Guess so. Nice, Garchomp! Great battle! "
10,40,194,GARCHOMP,[PLEASED] 
10,40,195,VOICE ,You see? 
10,40,196,VOICE ,I told you he'd be embarrassed. 
10,40,197,VOICE ,What a loser! 
10,40,198,ASH,"Hey, knock it off! "
10,40,199,DAWN,"But, Ash! What's up with him? "
10,40,200,BROCK,I think Ash has some new found respect for Paul after challenging Cynthia the way he did. 
10,40,201,ASH,"I'll tell you, Paul it was great! "
10,40,202,PAUL,"Well, I'll work on it and try again. "
10,40,203,CYNTHIA,I'll look forward to it! 
10,40,204,PAUL,Goodbye. 
10,40,205,ASH,Paul? Hey wait! That's not where the Pokémon Center is you know. 
10,40,206,CYNTHIA,"Paul, hold it right there! "
10,40,207,CYNTHIA,"Bringing injured Pokémon to a Pokémon Center is a trainer's first responsibility, you know! "
10,40,208,PAUL,Right. 
10,40,209,NURSE JOY,I'm terribly sorry. 
10,40,210,NURSE JOY,We've got an urgent situation here now! I've got to get into surgery right away! 
10,40,211,NURSE JOY,Please forgive me! 
10,40,212,CYNTHIA,"Then, there's no choice. "
10,40,213,CYNTHIA,I'll have to treat them myself! 
10,40,214,ASH,You'll do it? 
10,40,215,PIKACHU,[CURIOUS] 
10,40,216,BROCK,I'll help you! 
10,40,217,BROCK,"Anything you need, you just let me know! "
10,40,218,CROAGUNK,[CROAKING] 
10,40,219,CROAGUNK,[SURPRISED] [BASHFUL] 
10,40,220,CYNTHIA,We've got quite a fever going here. 
10,40,221,ASH,"But that Brick Break landed on Torterra's head, didn't it? "
10,40,222,CYNTHIA,"That's true, but the shock from that move spread all over the body! "
10,40,223,CYNTHIA,So we treat everywhere not only the part that was hit. 
10,40,224,DAWN,You're such a great champion! You know everything! 
10,40,225,CYNTHIA,And now it's your turn! 
10,40,226,CYNTHIA,Chimchar? I want you to take this. 
10,40,227,CHIMCHAR,[AGREEING] / [HAPPY] 
10,40,228,CYNTHIA,That was excellent! I'm proud of you! 
10,40,229,CHIMCHAR,[HAPPY] 
10,40,230,CYNTHIA,"There, time for some more rest. "
10,40,231,ASH,Chimchar looks a lot better now! 
10,40,232,PIKACHU,[HAPPY] 
10,40,233,CHIMCHAR,[SLEEPY] 
10,40,234,DAWN,"Look, the flame on Chimchar's tail! "
10,40,235,BROCK,When Chimchar sleeps the flame goes out! 
10,40,236,DAWN,Ohhh..[AMAZED] 
10,40,237,JESSIE,I'll bet you two every Pokémon in there wants us to steal them! 
10,40,238,JAMES,The poor dears are just not aware of it yet that's all! 
10,40,239,MEOWTH,"Of course. Hey, that's the ticket. "
10,40,240,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,40,241,CYNTHIA,All set! I'm done with your Pokémon. 
10,40,242,PAUL,"Thanks a lot, Cynthia. "
10,40,243,CYNTHIA,"Paul, your Pokémon are all very well trained. And I'm especially impressed with your Torterra. It's really quite amazing! "
10,40,244,PAUL,Torterra was my very first Pokémon. 
10,40,245,DAWN,That's incredible! 
10,40,246,BROCK,You raised it from a Turtwig? 
10,40,247,PAUL,Right. 
10,40,248,PAUL,"We've traveled a lot. We made our way through the Hoenn,Johto, and Kanto leagues but didn't win any of them. "
10,40,249,PAUL,It was also during that time I caught Weavile and Murkrow. 
10,40,250,ASH,What about Chimchar? 
10,40,251,PAUL,After I came back to Sinnoh. 
10,40,252,CYNTHIA,You've done a lot with Chimchar in such a short time! 
10,40,253,PAUL,"So what? After all, Chimchar didn't do such a great job against Garchomp if you remember. "
10,40,254,ASH,Until you got hit with that Giga Impact I don't think you cared how many of your Pokémon took a fall! - 
10,40,255,PAUL,Your point? - 
10,40,256,ASH,C'mon! How do you think your Pokémon felt about that? 
10,40,257,ASH,Don't you get it Paul? Winning that way's only a win for you! 
10,40,258,PAUL,Oh give me a break A win is a win! 
10,40,259,ASH,No way! The only real win is when you get it along with your Pokémon! 
10,40,260,ASH,Why don't you care about your Pokémon? 
10,40,261,PAUL,Because then they'll get spoiled. And Chimchar is the perfect example of exactly what I mean. 
10,40,262,PAUL,A spoiled Pokémon who doesn't try hard enough! 
10,40,263,ASH,"Well, you're wrong! You've got to support your Pokémon! Then they'll support you! - "
10,40,264,PAUL,Pathetic. - 
10,40,265,ASH,What? 
10,40,266,ASH,What counts in a battle is the bond between you and yourPokémon! You'll never win your way! 
10,40,267,PIKACHU,[ANGRY] 
10,40,268,PAUL,You just keep doing things your way. I'll become stronger any way I choose. 
10,40,269,CYNTHIA,You want to get stronger? 
10,40,270,CYNTHIA,If you do.There's something I want you to see. 
10,40,271,PIKACHU,[CONFUSED] 
10,40,272,CYNTHIA,The words that are written here completely changed my life. 
10,40,273,CYNTHIA,Listen while I read them. 
10,40,274,CYNTHIA,"""When every life meets another life. something will be born."" "
10,40,275,ASH,When every life. 
10,40,276,BROCK,Meets another life. 
10,40,277,DAWN,Something will be born? 
10,40,278,CYNTHIA,"When I was younger I used to dream of nothing other than becoming powerful through being victorious in battle, and so I trained endlessly. "
10,40,279,CYNTHIA,Then I discovered that even the same types of Pokémon have unique personalities! 
10,40,280,CYNTHIA,It was at that moment I decided I wanted to get to know each and every one of them better. 
10,40,281,CYNTHIA,"And then, after meeting more and more Pokémon.learning more of their ways.something completely new began to stir deep within my soul. I knew meeting new Pokémon was just like meeting new people! "
10,40,282,CYNTHIA,I'm sure because of our meeting today something powerful has been placed in each one of us. 
10,40,283,CYNTHIA,Something important! Something that will make us stronger in our own ways. 
10,40,284,CYNTHIA,My desire to learn about Pokémon has spawned a dream. that someday I'll actually meet the Legendary Dialga and Palkia! 
10,40,285,CYNTHIA,Then.perhaps I'll be able to travel back to the source and find the timeless origin of all Pokémon! 
10,40,286,BROCK,It would be amazing to meet Dialga and Palkia. 
10,40,287,DAWN,It sure would. 
10,40,288,CYNTHIA,Yes! 
10,40,289,JESSIE,Chimchar seems totally tuckered! 
10,40,290,JAMES,No wonder! The rigors of Twerp ownership. 
10,40,291,MEOWTH,It's time to lift this poor lug out of its lousy life! 
10,40,292,MEOWTH,"Matter of fact, we're gonna give all of these guys a lift! "
10,40,293,NURSE JOY,"Hello! Excuse me, but what are you doing here? "
10,40,294,MEOWTH,Sandman? 
10,40,295,JESSIE,You grab Chimchar Let's run! 
10,40,296,JAMES,Grabbing ho! 
10,40,297,NURSE JOY,Come back! That's not your Chimchar! 
10,40,298,ASH,Chimchar.? 
10,40,299,ASH,That's Paul's! 
10,40,300,DAWN,And Team Rocket's got it! 
10,40,301,ASH,Stop! 
10,40,302,JAMES,A g*ng a' Twerps! 
10,40,303,MEOWTH,And that top of the line trainer babe! - 
10,40,304,DAWN,Give Chimchar back! - 
10,40,305,BROCK,Or you'll be sorry! 
10,40,306,JESSIE,"She runs, she jumps! "
10,40,307,JESSIE,Now you take your lumps! 
10,40,308,CYNTHIA,[SHOCKED] 
10,40,309,CYNTHIA,Oh dear! 
10,40,310,JAMES,I'll take that as a compliment! 
10,40,311,MEOWTH,Any 'dear' from 
10,40,312,CHIMCHAR,[CURIOUS] 
10,40,313,JESSIE,Little Chimmie woke up! 
10,40,314,JAMES,Welcome to our world! 
10,40,315,JESSIE,Bringing chaos at a break neck pace! 
10,40,316,JAMES,"Dashing all hope, putting fear in its pathetic place! "
10,40,317,MEOWTH,"Mess with Team Rocket, we're in your face! "
10,40,318,CHIMCHAR ,[FLAMETHROWER MOVE] 
10,40,319,MEOWTH,Heh.

10,40,331,MEOWTH,"Hey kids, know of a red hot Pokémon we could strike a real match with? "
10,40,332,WOBBUFFET,[AMUSED] 
10,40,333,JESSIE,We're blasting off again! 
10,40,334,CHIMCHAR,[PAINED] 
10,40,335,PAUL,"Look, I don't care if you did get injured. To be captured by a bunch of losers. "
10,40,336,PAUL,Useless! 
10,40,337,CHIMCHAR,[SAD] 
10,40,338,ASH,How could you be so mean? 
10,40,339,DAWN,Chimchar was sleeping when Team Rocket grabbed it! 
10,40,340,CYNTHIA,"All right, enough! The important thing now is Chimchar's safe and sound! "
10,40,341,CYNTHIA,"Dear, sweet.Chimchar. "
10,40,342,CHIMCHAR,[HAPPY] 
10,40,343,DAWN,"You're right. Of course that's the only thing that matters at this point, I know! - "
10,40,344,BROCK,I agree. - 
10,40,345,ASH,"You bet, Chimchar! "
10,40,346,PIKACHU,[HAPPY] 
10,40,347,CYNTHIA,"You know, Paul for the sake of your Pokémon, youshould spend the night at the Pokémon Center. "
10,40,348,CYNTHIA,"You want to get stronger too, right? "
10,40,349,PAUL,"Well, all right. "
10,40,350,RHONDA,This newsflash! 
10,40,351,RHONDA,Here at the ancient ruins in Celestic Town. 
10,40,352,RHONDA,".the Lustrous Orb, related to the Legendary Pokémon Palkia, has been discovered! "
10,40,353,ASH,Lustrous? Like the Adamant Orb? 
10,40,354,CYNTHIA,They finally found it! 
10,40,355,RHONDA,"The Lustrous Orb is the companion of the magnificent Adamant Orb, currently on exhibit in Eterna City, and is said to increase the powers of Palkia! "
10,40,356,RHONDA,"With this discovery, scientists hope to learn much more about the Legend of Sinnoh Space and Time! "
10,40,357,CYNTHIA,Now I know where I'm traveling to next. 
10,40,358,DAWN,"Celestic Town, is that right? - "
10,40,359,CYNTHIA,Right! - 
10,40,360,ASH,"You know. I'm still not really sure just what you weretalking about back there...But I do know I love Pokémon just as much as you do, Cynthia! "
10,40,361,CYNTHIA,Good! And that's all you need to know to become stronger in your own way!

10,38,369,NURSE JOY,"Right! And I'll be quite busy with all the Forest Pokémon too! Thanks to all of you. Especially you, dear Brock... "
10,38,370,BROCK,Thanks to you.

10,37,8,BROCK,"Well, you couldn't find a better space - for Grass-type Pokémon! - "
10,37,9,YOKO,Of course! And you know that's what Gym Leader Gardenia's all about. 
10,37,10,GARDENIA,"Hey, Ash! "
10,37,11,GARDENIA,Welcome to Eterna Gym! Today's finally the day of our battle! Let's make it a battle to remember!

10,37,14,JESSIE,The Eterna Gym in all its glorious greenery! 
10,37,15,JAMES,With a Pikachu prize inside! 
10,37,16,MEOWTH,Let's put our hole-digging to good use and grab it from underneath! 
10,37,17,JESSIE,Great! Creative! 
10,37,18,JAMES,The same old same old is creative? 
10,37,19,JESSIE,Doing the thing we do best sure is! So let's put those shovels to the dirt and dig with Team Rocket gusto! - 
10,37,20,MEOWTH,Yo! - 
10,37,21,JAMES,Whoa! 
10,37,22,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,37,23,YOKO,"The Eterna City Gym battle between Ash, the challenger, and Gardenia, the Gym Leader, will now begin! Three Pokémon will be used, and the challenge is over when all of one side's Pokémon are unable to battle! Furthermore, only the challenger will be allowed to substitute Pokémon during the battle! "
10,37,24,ASH,"Hang back, Pikachu! You understand what's going on, right? "
10,37,25,BROCK,Of course an Electric type would be at a big disadvantage against a Grass type. 
10,37,26,YOKO,"All right, let the battle begin! "
10,37,27,GARDENIA,"Okay, Cherubi, let's go! "
10,37,28,ASH,"All right, Turtwig, I choose you! "
10,37,29,DAWN,That looks like a good matchup to me! 
10,37,30,BROCK,A battle between two Grass types! 
10,37,31,GARDENIA,"Okay, Ash, you've got the honor! "
10,37,32,ASH,"Then here we go! Now, Turtwig, Tackle! "
10,37,33,TURTWIG,[TACKLE MOVE] 
10,37,34,GARDENIA,"Dodge it, quick! "
10,37,35,ASH,Use Razor Leaf! 
10,37,36,TURTWIG,[RAZOR LEAF MOVE] 
10,37,37,CHERUBI,[EFFORT] 
10,37,38,TURTWIG,[FRUSTRATED] 
10,37,39,ASH,That Cherubi sure is fast! 
10,37,40,GARDENIA,"Watch what happens in the sun! The brighter the sun, the faster the Cherubi gets! "
10,37,41,DAWN,Is that true? 
10,37,42,BROCK,"It's a special Ability Cherubi can use, called Chlorophyll! "
10,37,43,GARDENIA,Now for the perfect move on a sunny day: Solar Beam! 
10,37,44,CHERUBI,[SOLAR BEAM MOVE] 
10,37,45,ASH,Dodge! 
10,37,46,TURTWIG,[EFFORT] 
10,37,47,ASH,"Solar Beam takes time to charge up, so they can't fire again right away! Now, Turtwig! Use Razor Leaf! "

10,37,49,GARDENIA,Solar Beam!

10,37,55,CHERUBI,[MAGICAL LEAF MOVE] 
10,37,56,ASH,"Turtwig, return! "
10,37,57,CHERUBI,[DEFIANT] 
10,37,58,GARDENIA,"Ash, you've made a wise choice! In the past, you probably would've battled until your Pokémon had collapsed in a heap! - My, have you grown! - "
10,37,59,DAWN,That was a close one! 
10,37,60,BROCK,"If you take that kind of speed and power, then add in the bright sun. You've got the formula for one tough opponent! "
10,37,61,JESSIE,First we tunnel through the earth. Then take the Twerps for all they're worth! 
10,37,62,JESSIE,And soon they'll be one Pikachu light! 
10,37,63,JAMES,Baffled and clueless. What a sight! 
10,37,64,MEOWTH,That's. Right! Look out! 
10,37,65,MEOWTH,"Hey, where are we? "
10,37,66,JESSIE,"For a Grass-type Gym, it's a little light on grass! "
10,37,67,JAMES,Maybe they're conserving water. 
10,37,68,UNDERGROUND MAN,Hmm. You three sure aren't dressed like miners. 
10,37,69,JESSIE,"Listen, is that a crusty old codger type that I hear? "
10,37,70,JAMES,He's crusting to me loud and clear! - 
10,37,71,JESSIE,What a sound! - 
10,37,72,JAMES,Underground! 
10,37,73,MEOWTH,In my ear! 
10,37,74,JESSIE,"Well, we can out-dig you at a breakneck pace! "
10,37,75,JAMES,With nary a trace of dirt anyplace! 
10,37,76,JESSIE,Careful how you pick your fights. 
10,37,77,JAMES,Or we just may have to punch out your lights! - 
10,37,78,JESSIE,Jessie here! - 
10,37,79,JAMES,Here with James! 
10,37,80,MEOWTH,Meowth's my name! 
10,37,81,JESSIE,Putting milquetoast miners in their place!

10,37,83,JESSIE,And we're in your face! 
10,37,84,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,37,85,MIME JR,[MIMICKING] 
10,37,86,UNDERGROUND MAN,Come on! You're telling me you guys are really Team Rocket? 
10,37,87,MEOWTH,"Hey, you know who we are? "
10,37,88,UNDERGROUND MAN,Not a clue! I'm what they call in the treasure-digging business an Eterna City underground explorer! 
10,37,89,JESSIE,That sounds promising. 
10,37,90,JAMES,It would follow there's treasure down here. 
10,37,91,UNDERGROUND MAN,"Right! Red spheres, blue spheres, green spheres. You just wouldn't believe how much this stuff is worth! "
10,37,92,JESSIE,Try us! 
10,37,93,JESSIE,We'll help! We've got tools! 
10,37,94,JAMES,We're digging fools! 
10,37,95,MEOWTH,Treasure digging rules! 
10,37,96,UNDERGROUND MAN,"Well, I could sure use a hand, and there's more than enough to go around! It's all for one! "
10,37,97,JESSIE,What fun! 
10,37,98,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,37,99,ASH,Staravia! I choose you! 
10,37,100,STARAVIA,[APPEARING] 
10,37,101,GARDENIA,"Just because you choose a Pokémon that's a good matchup doesn't mean you're gonna win! All right, Cherubi, use Solar Beam! "
10,37,102,ASH,"Dodge it, then use Wing att*ck! "
10,37,103,STARAVIA,[WING att*ck MOVE] 
10,37,104,GARDENIA,Dodge it! 
10,37,105,GARDENIA,"Okay, Solar Beam once more! "
10,37,106,CHERUBI,[SOLAR BEAM MOVE] 
10,37,107,GARDENIA,Oh no! The sun! 
10,37,108,BROCK,No sun means it'll take longer for Cherubi to charge! 
10,37,109,GARDENIA,"Well, you can't trust the weather, right? Cherubi! Switch to Magical Leaf! "
10,37,110,CHERUBI,[MAGICAL LEAF MOVE] 
10,37,111,ASH,No time to dodge. Staravia! Up! 
10,37,112,STARAVIA,[CONFIDENT]

10,37,114,DAWN,"Hurry and att*ck, Ash! "
10,37,115,ASH,Staravia! Come down nice and slow! 
10,37,116,CHERUBI,[CONCERNED] 
10,37,117,STARAVIA,[FOCUSED] 
10,37,118,DAWN,So why doesn't Ash att*ck? 
10,37,119,ASH,"All right! Staravia! Wing att*ck, now! "
10,37,120,GARDENIA,"Cherubi, dodge it and go for the counter! "
10,37,121,STARAVIA,[CONFIDENT] 
10,37,122,CHERUBI,[WORRIED] 
10,37,123,ASH,Way to go! Keep going! 
10,37,124,STARAVIA,[CONFIDENT] 
10,37,125,ASH,Now right into Quick att*ck! 
10,37,126,STARAVIA,[QUICK att*ck MOVE] 
10,37,127,CHERUBI,[PAINED] 
10,37,128,ASH,And finish with Aerial Ace! 
10,37,129,CHERUBI,[PAINED] - 
10,37,130,DAWN,"Wow, what a hit! - "
10,37,131,BROCK,I think that did it! 
10,37,132,GARDENIA,Cherubi! 
10,37,133,YOKO,Cherubi is unable to battle! Staravia wins! 
10,37,134,ASH,"Good going, Staravia! "
10,37,135,GARDENIA,"Thanks! Take a long rest! Well, Ash, you did it! Nice turn around with the sun, too! "
10,37,136,ASH,It's like you said. Can't trust the weather! I learned that from you! 
10,37,137,GARDENIA,"Oh you heard me say that from there, huh? Good ears! Turtwig, you're next! - "
10,37,138,DAWN,No surprise to me! - 
10,37,139,BROCK,Yeah! 
10,37,140,STARAVIA,[DETERMINED] 
10,37,141,ASH,"That's right, remember? You didn't like losing before, did you? "
10,37,142,ASH,"Well, not this time! Staravia, use Wing att*ck! "
10,37,143,STARAVIA,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,37,144,GARDENIA,"Turtwig, dodge! "
10,37,145,STARAVIA,[WING att*ck MOVE] 
10,37,146,ASH,Now keep using Wing att*ck! 
10,37,147,GARDENIA,And dodge every one! 
10,37,148,TURTWIG [G],[BATTLING] 
10,37,149,BROCK,Oh no! Turtwig's too fast! 
10,37,150,DAWN,"Ash, come on! Change it up! "
10,37,151,ASH,Just keep using Wing att*ck! 
10,37,152,GARDENIA,This is starting to get a little old. 
10,37,153,TURTWIG [G],[BATTLING] 
10,37,154,GARDENIA,"Look out! It's a trap, Turtwig! "
10,37,155,GARDENIA,Turtwig! 
10,37,156,DAWN,That's what that was for! 
10,37,157,BROCK,Turtwig's good and stuck now! 
10,37,158,ASH,"Now, Aerial Ace! "
10,37,159,STARAVIA,[AERIAL ACE MOVE] 
10,37,160,TURTWIG [G],[PAINED] -

10,37,163,ASH,Let's wrap this up! Staravia! Wing att*ck! 
10,37,164,GARDENIA,"Turtwig, Leech Seed! "
10,37,165,TURTWIG [G],[LEECH SEED MOVE] 
10,37,166,STARAVIA,[SHOCKED] -

10,37,171,YOKO,Staravia is unable to battle! Turtwig's the winner! 
10,37,172,GARDENIA,"Awesome, Turtwig, great! "
10,37,173,DAWN,And things were going so well. 
10,37,174,BROCK,I guess that's why Gardenia's the leader of this Gym. 
10,37,175,BROCK,But I'm sure Ash's att*cks have taken their toll. 
10,37,176,ASH,You were great! And don't worry. We're gonna win this one! 
10,37,177,ASH,"All right, Turtwig, I choose you! "

10,37,181,UNDERGROUND MAN,"It's obvious to me that you guys have done this lots of times before, haven't you? "
10,37,182,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",Of course! 
10,37,183,JESSIE,"See, when it comes to a pick, we're super slick! "
10,37,184,JAMES,Failing to catch Pikachu's given us piles of practice! 
10,37,185,MEOWTH,"When it comes to digging a hole, we're always on a roll! "
10,37,186,UNDERGROUND MAN,"Well, is that right? You just keep digging like that, and we'll be rolling in treasure real quick! "
10,37,187,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH","Slick trick! Pick, pick, pick, pick, pick, pick, pick, pick. "
10,37,188,MEOWTH,I think we sprung a leak! 
10,37,189,UNDERGROUND MAN,What a beauty! 
10,37,190,JESSIE,What's a beauty? 
10,37,191,JAMES,Unearthed something of worth? 
10,37,192,UNDERGROUND MAN,"This is a high-quality red sphere y'all just found! Folks, I think you all just went and hit the jackpot! "
10,37,193,JAMES,Cross your heart? 
10,37,194,JESSIE,Poaching Pikachu pales when compared to this! 
10,37,195,MEOWTH,Then back to digging bliss! 
10,37,196,UNDERGROUND MAN,"Great! Keep it up, folks! You're gonna make me one healthy dude! "
10,37,197,ASH,"Turtwig! Tackle, let's go! "

10,37,232,TURTWIG [A],[PROUD] 
10,37,233,GARDENIA,"Ash, I'm really impressed with the bond you have with your Pokémon. But don't forget you still have some more work to do if you want to earn that badge! "
10,37,234,ASH,I know! And I can't think of anything else I want to do! 
10,37,235,DAWN,I'm glad Ash and Turtwig managed to turn that around! 
10,37,236,BROCK,Yeah! But that Leech Seed is still in play! If this drags on that could be a real problem!

10,36,48,NANDO,Poor Sunflora became frightened and ran away. 
10,36,49,NANDO,"Then life took its course, as it is wont to do. "
10,36,50,NANDO,And in the blink of an eye I find myself standing before you! 
10,36,51,JENNY,Stop! Sunflora wasn't frightened.you let it escape! 
10,36,52,NANDO,But we are guilty of nothing.

10,36,68,DAWN,Awesome! The Floaroma Contest is where I won my first! 
10,36,69,JENNY ,You stop this right now! This is serious! 
10,36,70,JENNY ,"Now, as for you, Why aren't you doing your job as Gym Leader? "
10,36,71,GARDENIA,"You see, when I get a small break sometimes, I like to get out of the Gym for a while! "
10,36,72,ASH,Uh.I just went over to the Eterna Gym to challenge it before... 
10,36,73,DAWN,"Yeah, but nobody was there! "
10,36,74,BROCK,So we decided to come here and k*ll some time until the Gym Leader came back! 
10,36,75,GARDENIA,"Oopsie! Sorry, guys. "
10,36,76,JENNY ,"All of you, stop changing the subject! "
10,36,77,ASH,"Okay, sorry! But I'm telling you, Officer Jenny, Nando's no thief! "
10,36,78,PIKACHU,[INSISTENT] 
10,36,79,DAWN,"He's right.and besides, there were two thieves! "
10,36,80,BROCK,"Normally I agree with anything and everything you say, Officer Jenny, but I have to agree with Ash this time! "
10,36,81,GARDENIA,No one who loves Grass-type Pokémon could be a crook! 
10,36,82,JENNY ,Look at this. This was taken by security! How do you plan on explaining this? 
10,36,83,ASH,What? Sunflora? 
10,36,84,GARDENIA,"Whoa, is that for real? "
10,36,85,JENNY,I'm afraid this is all the evidence that I need! 
10,36,86,WOMAN'S VOICE,Objection! 
10,36,87,BROCK,Jenny? Whoa! 
10,36,88,GARDENIA,Oh my! Now there are two of them! 
10,36,89,JENNY [VIRIDIAN],There's more here than meets the eye! 
10,36,90,JENNY [V],"You see, all Sunflora Trainers here need to be investigated, not just one of them! "
10,36,91,JENNY [ETERNA],"Just where are you from, anyway? "
10,36,92,JENNY [V],I'm the Officer Jenny from Viridian City! I thought I'd come visit since today's my day off. 
10,36,93,ASH,Viridian City? That takes me back! 
10,36,94,JENNY [E],You have no authority here! So please just keep your opinions to yourself! 
10,36,95,JENNY [V],Now relax! There must be something I can do to help you out. 
10,36,96,JENNY [E],"No, we're just fine! The museum has been secured, which means all possible suspects are locked inside! It's only a matter of time before we capture the thieves who stole the Adamant Orb! "
10,36,97,JENNY [V],You sure are confident. 
10,36,98,JENNY [E],Enough not to let some Viridian police woman get in my way! 
10,36,99,DAWN,"Scary, aren't they? "

10,36,104,JESSIE,"So we fight! We punch, and then kick! "
10,36,105,MEOWTH,Just don't kick a hole in the Adamant Orb! 
10,36,106,JAMES,"In order to receive our reward, the Adamant Orb needs to stay in one piece more than us! "

10,36,110,JENNY [V],It's been said that the Adamant Orb can magnify the power of the Legendary Pokémon Dialga.

10,36,112,PIKACHU,[AMAZED] 
10,36,113,DAWN,"Yeah! There was a huge statue of it in front of the museum, wasn't there? "
10,36,114,DAWN,Right! Dialga is the Pokémon who controls time. 
10,36,115,DAWN,and Palkia is the Pokémon who controls space! 
10,36,116,GARDENIA,According to legend... 
10,36,117,GARDENIA,Dialga and Palkia formed the Sinnoh region long ago. 
10,36,118,GARDENIA,and there are countless ancient shrines devoted to the two of them scattered all over Sinnoh! 
10,36,119,GARDENIA,We know the Adamant Orb was dug up from one of those shrines! 
10,36,120,DAWN,I read that in a book of legends! It said the whole world was formed by those two! 
10,36,121,ASH,The world was formed by Pokémon? 
10,36,122,PIKACHU,[AMAZED] 
10,36,123,BROCK,"So, if that's true, where did the Pokémon come from, then? "
10,36,124,DAWN,Which came first.good question! Was it the world or Pokémon... 
10,36,125,GARDENIA,Here's what I think... 
10,36,126,GARDENIA,"By learning about Pokémon all that we can, We're really trying to learn about ourselves.about you and me, woman and man. "
10,36,127,BROCK,"Wow, that was beautiful poetry! "
10,36,128,DAWN,"Of course! You've been with Nando, right? "
10,36,129,GARDENIA,"Well, I am a Gym Leader! "
10,36,130,DAWN,If the sphere's that important... 
10,36,131,DAWN,"Then we have to get it back, now! "
10,36,132,ASH,"You're right! And help Nando, too! Let's get out there and capture the real crooks! "
10,36,133,JENNY [V],Sunflora's our best sh*t!

10,36,252,JAMES,Excuse me! Ditching a diamond for a dumb disguise makes you dumber than it! 
10,36,253,MEOWTH,Tough! It's what I do best! 
10,36,254,JESSIE,Not for long! 
10,36,255,GARDENIA,Nando's Sunflora's no criminal! 
10,36,256,ASH,"Yeah, but Team Rocket's Meowth sure is! "
10,36,257,JESSIE,Are those Twerp twits I hear? 
10,36,258,JAMES,That whining can't fool my ear! -

10,36,272,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,36,273,JENNY [V],That's not the same motto from Viridian City. 
10,36,274,JESSIE,"Hey, stop living in the past! "
10,36,275,JAMES,Sometimes you've gotta let go! 
10,36,276,MEOWTH,Sometimes you gotta shut up. 
10,36,277,ASH,"Hey, you guys, give back the Adamant Orb! "
10,36,278,JENNY [V],You have no idea of its historical worth! 
10,36,279,JESSIE,Save the history for school. Give me cash! 
10,36,280,JAMES,We were generously commissioned by a fashionably dressed fan of Team Rocket's to steal it for his collection of rocks! 
10,36,281,JENNY [V],Who'd do that? 
10,36,282,ASH,That's it.don't let them get away!

10,36,296,JESSIE,Diamonds are a girl's best friend. 
10,36,297,DAWN,What do we do now? 
10,36,298,BROCK,We can't att*ck them directly! 
10,36,299,JENNY [V],Wish we could call the Eterna City Jenny.

10,36,302,AIPOM,[SURPRISED] 
10,36,303,JENNY [E],I was completely wrong about you. I hope you'll forgive me!

10,36,326,PIKACHU,[AMAZED] 
10,36,327,JESSIE,"Why don't you fling this back at them, Wobbuffet? "
10,36,328,WOBBUFFET,[OBJECTING] 
10,36,329,JENNY [E],"Because that wasn't a Pokémon move! It's a defense tactic that Stunky has, and it lasts for  long hours! "
10,36,330,ASH,"Man, that's staying power! "
10,36,331,PIKACHU,[AGREEMENT] 
10,36,332,DAWN,That's a whole day and night! 
10,36,333,BROCK,What a treat!

10,36,335,JENNY [V],It's over. 
10,36,336,JAMES,I'm afraid this takes B.O. to a whole new level. -

10,36,346,JENNY [E],You know.we may have overdone it a little bit this time! 
10,36,347,STUNKY,[SHEEPISH] 
10,36,348,JENNY [V],This time? Overdoing it is something that all Jennys do very well! 
10,36,349,BROCK,"That's more like it. Beautiful Jennys, best of friends. "
10,36,350,JENNY [E],"Nando, thank you for all your help! "
10,36,351,STUNKY,[GRATEFUL] 
10,36,352,NANDO,You're welcome! My pleasure. I'm just glad the Adamant Orb is safe. Eterna City is my favorite! A city that unites past and present! 
10,36,353,ASH,Nando? So are the legends of Dialga and Palkia really true? 
10,36,354,PIKACHU,[CURIOUS] 
10,36,355,NANDO,"In the beginning, there was only a churning turmoil of chaos. "
10,36,356,NANDO,"And at the heart of the chaos, where all things become one, came the One! "
10,36,357,NANDO,"And from itself, the Original One formed two beings. "
10,36,358,NANDO,"Time began to spin, and space began to expand. Then, the Original One separated into three more beings... Matter was born by way of communion between the first two. and spirit was born by way of communion between the next three. Our world was formed, and the Original One fell into a deep sleep. This is a legend that has been handed down since ancient times. "
10,36,359,ASH,"Sorry, but I don't get it! "
10,36,360,DAWN,Me neither! It's all so mysterious! 
10,36,361,NANDO,"Have patience, Dawn, and one day you will fully understand that all people are walking side by side toward their dreams, together with the world's Pokémon. It's bright young ones like you that have shown me this. "
10,36,362,DAWN,I get that! 
10,36,363,GARDENIA,Makes sense to me! 
10,36,364,ASH,"Me, too! "
10,36,365,GARDENIA,Sorry about today. Why don't you get your Pokémon ready and then come see me? I will be there. 
10,36,366,ASH,"Okay and then you and I can get that second badge, right? "
10,36,367,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
10,36,368,NARRATOR,"Working with two Officer Jennys, our heroes helped return an important treasure to the Sinnoh museum and the world! Now Ash's Eterna City battle challenge awaits! "
10,36,369,JENNY [V],"I still wonder who commissioned Team Rocket to steal the Adamant Orb. I guess.as long as that question remains unanswered, this case is still open! "
10,36,370,BROCK,"Hey, hold on! "
10,36,371,BROCK,What about other Team Rocket members? 
10,36,372,JENNY [E],Yes that could be. 
10,36,373,JENNY [E],or maybe a Pokémon Hunter! 
10,36,374,JENNY [V],Maybe. 
10,36,375,JENNY [V],or maybe something worse! 
10,36,376,TEAM GALACTIC GRUNT [MALE],"Well, those three were totally useless. "
10,36,377,TEAM GALACTIC GRUNT [FEMALE],We'll get the Adamant Orb next time... TO BE CONTINUED..

10,35,20,DAWN,"Aww, why is Buizel doing this? "
10,35,21,BROCK,I think it's good to remember that Buizel's been spending all of its time training alone. 
10,35,22,ASH,"I'll bet a good battle would make Buizel feel great! So what do you say, Buizel, are you up for it or what? "
10,35,23,BUIZEL,[AFFIRMATIVE] An Elite Meet And Greet!

10,35,97,JAMES,"A member of the Elite Four, no less! "
10,35,98,JESSIE,Sounds familiar. 
10,35,99,MEOWTH,The Elite Four are a group of four of the tip-toppiest of Trainers! 
10,35,100,JAMES,And you can be sure they've got a gaggle of the pick-pickiest of prime Pokémon! 
10,35,101,JESSIE,You know what I say. Why steal from the rest when you can steal from the best? 
10,35,102,BROCK,"So, it's true that only Pokémon Trainers who've won in their home Leagues can join the Champion League, correct? "
10,35,103,LUCIAN,"Right. If you're from Hoenn, you have to have won the Hoenn League, or Johto, the Johto League! Which brings us to the Sinnoh League.a monumental task,of course, but necessary to challenge us! "
10,35,104,ASH,Now that would be a real battle between Champions! 
10,35,105,DAWN,So you're saying.win here and you can challenge the Elite Four! 
10,35,106,LUCIAN,"That's right. You see, the Sinnoh Elite Four is made up of yours truly, who specializes in Psychic Pokémon; Aaron, who specializes in Bug Pokémon;Bertha, a Ground-type Pokémon specialist; and Flint, who's great with Fire types! And presiding at the top of the Elite Four is Cynthia, Master of the Champion League! But if you wish to challenge her, you first have to defeat all four of us.the Elite Four! "
10,35,107,DAWN,So Cynthia's the very top of the top! 
10,35,108,ASH,"Far as I'm concerned, that's what it's all about! "
10,35,109,BUIZEL,[EXCITED]

10,35,113,DAWN,When will you learn to mind your manners? 
10,35,114,BUIZEL,[EXCITED] 
10,35,115,LUCIAN,"No, it's fine. And I accept Buizel's challenge. "
10,35,116,ASH,"Do you think,you'd battle with me and Pikachu first? "
10,35,117,LUCIAN,"So, Ash, am I correct in assuming that your goal is to - conquer the Sinnoh League? - "
10,35,118,ASH,Right! 
10,35,119,LUCIAN,"Well, I guarantee you can look forward to having that battle with me immediately after you've attained your goal! "
10,35,120,LUCIAN,"But as for right now, Buizel asked. And I'm honoring that request! "

10,35,170,BUIZEL,[PAINED] 
10,35,171,DAWN,Buizel! 
10,35,172,BUIZEL,[PAINED] [IMPACT] 
10,35,173,DAWN,"Buizel, are you okay? "
10,35,174,BUIZEL,[STRUGGLING] - 
10,35,175,ASH,"Whoa, tough break. - "
10,35,176,LUCIAN,I'm terribly sorry. I seem to have gotten a bit carried away by Buizel's fighting spirit. 
10,35,177,LUCIAN,Please go and see Nurse Joy. - 
10,35,178,DAWN,We will. - 
10,35,179,LUCIAN,Till we meet again. 
10,35,180,BROCK,Not even one of Buizel's att*cks made contact at all! 
10,35,181,ASH,I know. The Elite Four sure are tough. 
10,35,182,JESSIE,Whoa. That Bronzong made puree out of that Twerp duo. 
10,35,183,JAMES,Say.I wonder if the Boss even likes puree. 
10,35,184,MEOWTH,"There is a chance the Boss'll be clueless as to Bronzong's , uses. Matter of fact, he may go bonkers trying to figure out what to do with that bazooka-brain! When you get down to brass tacks,there may be only one thing he can do. Leave it on the porch anduse it as a giant door knocker! "
10,35,185,JAMES,Then he'll use us as firewood! 
10,35,186,MEOWTH,There's nothing wrong with tweaking our plan if things get goofy. 
10,35,187,JAMES,When it comes to the Boss... 
10,35,188,JESSIE,We're goofy enough! 
10,35,189,BUIZEL,[WHIMPERING] 
10,35,190,DAWN,Buizel! 
10,35,191,NURSE JOY,Things should be fine now. 
10,35,192,ASH,"Awesome, Buizel! "
10,35,193,BROCK,That was a great battle! 
10,35,194,ASH,[SURPRISED] 
10,35,195,DAWN,I guess losing was a big shock after all... 
10,35,196,BROCK,I think so... 
10,35,197,ASH,"Remember, way back at the river, Buizel was unbeatable... "
10,35,198,PIKACHU,[REASSURING] 
10,35,199,BUIZEL,[DEJECTED] 
10,35,200,PIKACHU,[CONCERNED] 
10,35,201,ASH,"Wow, this is bad. "
10,35,202,JOY,"Well, I think I have just the thing. A nice bowl of soup! "
10,35,203,BROCK,"Dear Nurse Joy, there's no doubt you have just the thing! See, the combination of your beauty plus your nursing and cooking skills knocks me out cold! - "
10,35,204,BROCK,See what I mean? - 
10,35,205,JOY,Oh. 
10,35,206,CROAGUNK,[SATISFIED] 
10,35,207,PIKACHU,[CONCERNED] 
10,35,208,CROAGUNK,[CONCERNED] 
10,35,209,ASH,"When you get stared down by Croagunk and nothing happens, it's got to be serious. "
10,35,210,DAWN,Guess I never should've let Buizel battle...much less have a battle with one of the Elite Four! 
10,35,211,ASH,I know! 
10,35,212,ASH,[DELIGHTED] 
10,35,213,ASH,There's nothing like the great outdoors to pick your spirits right up! 
10,35,214,PIKACHU,[AGREEMENT] 
10,35,215,ASH,"Buizel, I heard there's a gigantic river around here! Why don't we all go swimming? "
10,35,216,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
10,35,217,ASH,"Man, I was sure that would work. "
10,35,218,PIKACHU,[RESIGNED] 
10,35,219,LUCIAN,"Hello, everyone! "
10,35,220,LUCIAN,I thought I'd find you all out here! - 
10,35,221,ASH,"Hey, Lucian! - "
10,35,222,DAWN,Look there. Buizel just hasn't been the same since losing our battle. 
10,35,223,LUCIAN,"Then it's time. A very important time, too! "
10,35,224,DAWN,What do you mean? 
10,35,225,LUCIAN,Buizel's standing at a crossroads and needs to make a choice. 
10,35,226,LUCIAN,The choice of exactly what to do with defeat! 
10,35,227,LUCIAN,Buizel can continue loving to battle like before... 
10,35,228,LUCIAN,Or not. 
10,35,229,BUIZEL,[SURPRISED] / [SCARED] - 
10,35,230,DAWN,"Buizel, no! - "
10,35,231,LUCIAN,Now what's going on? 
10,35,232,JESSIE,Listen! Is that one of the Elite Four I hear? 
10,35,233,JAMES,You're listening to the Elite Three. Is that clear? - 
10,35,234,JESSIE,On the wind! - 
10,35,235,JAMES,Past the stars! - 
10,35,236,MEOWTH,In your ear! - 
10,35,237,JESSIE,Hear hear! 
10,35,238,JESSIE,Bringing chaos at a breakneck pace! 
10,35,239,JAMES,"Dashing all hope, putting fear in its place! "
10,35,240,JESSIE,A rose by any other name is just as sweet! 
10,35,241,JAMES,"When everything's worse, our work is complete! - "
10,35,242,JESSIE,Jessie! - 
10,35,243,JAMES,And James! 
10,35,244,MEOWTH,"Meowth,that's a name! "
10,35,245,JESSIE,Putting the do-gooders in their place! - 
10,35,246,JAMES,We're Team Rocket! - 
10,35,247,JESSIE,In your face! 
10,35,248,ASH,Team Rocket! 
10,35,249,LUCIAN,What are you going to do with Buizel? 
10,35,250,JESSIE,Where's that Elite brain? 
10,35,251,JAMES,We were going to give Bronzong to the Boss. 
10,35,252,MEOWTH,But Buizel will give us much more bang for the buck! 
10,35,253,LUCIAN,"Normally I would be quite upset with people like you, but.I'm not. "
10,35,254,BUIZEL,[ANGRY] - 
10,35,255,ASH,"I'll save you, Buizel! - "
10,35,256,DAWN,Me too! 
10,35,257,LUCIAN,"Now hold on. You see, this may be just the chance Buizel's been waiting for. "
10,35,258,DAWN,I'm not sure what you mean. 
10,35,259,BUIZEL,[ANGRY] 
10,35,260,BUIZEL,[FURIOUS] 
10,35,261,ASH,"Whoa, check it out! "
10,35,262,DAWN,"Wow, up until a minute ago Buizel was so depressed! "
10,35,263,LUCIAN,Buizel's anger at being caged has completely erased the sadness over losing our battle! 
10,35,264,DAWN,I hope so. 
10,35,265,BUIZEL,[SONIC BOOM MOVE] - 
10,35,266,ASH,It's Sonic Boom! - 
10,35,267,JESSIE,It's a sonic bust! 
10,35,268,JAMES,"When it comes to that cool cage, we spent more green than you Twerps have ever seen! "
10,35,269,MEOWTH,Buizel will break before it does! 
10,35,270,BUIZEL,[EFFORT] 
10,35,271,BUIZEL,[STRUGGLING] 
10,35,272,JESSIE,That's it. Have your fun! 
10,35,273,MEOWTH,We bought that basket with a second mortgage on our balloon and traded in James's bottlecap collection! 
10,35,274,JAMES,A sacrifice worth twice the price! 
10,35,275,BUIZEL,[STRUGGLING] - 
10,35,276,BROCK,Poor Buizel! - 
10,35,277,DAWN,"Buizel, don't give up! "
10,35,278,DAWN,You've got to do it! 
10,35,279,BUIZEL,[SONIC BOOM MOVE] 
10,35,280,BUIZEL,[TRIUMPHANT]

10,35,283,DAWN,Yes! - 
10,35,284,ASH,You did it! 
10,35,285,JESSIE,Did what? Mortgaged our future? 
10,35,286,MEOWTH,Andgave our beautiful balloon to some stupid bank? 
10,35,287,JAMES,Now you'll pay! 
10,35,288,JESSIE,"Quick, Dustox, come on out! "
10,35,289,JAMES,"You too, Carnivine, go! "
10,35,290,DUSTOX,[APPEARING] 
10,35,291,JAMES,There are better places for this than in a public forum! 
10,35,292,DAWN,"Great! Buizel, let's go! "
10,35,293,LUCIAN,"Hold on, Dawn. Not so fast! I'd like the honor! "
10,35,294,DAWN,Okay. 
10,35,295,JESSIE,"Dustox, use Tackle now! "
10,35,296,JAMES,"Carnivine, quick! Use Bite! "
10,35,297,DUSTOX,[BATTLING] 
10,35,298,DAWN,"Look out, Buizel! Dodge it! "
10,35,299,LUCIAN,"There's really no need for that at all. Buizel! Water g*n, let's go! "
10,35,300,BUIZEL,[WATER g*n MOVE] 
10,35,301,ASH,Buizel did just what Lucian said!

10,35,312,DUSTOX,[IMPACT] 
10,35,313,JESSIE,"They detoxed you,too! "
10,35,314,BUIZEL,[PLEASED] 
10,35,315,LUCIAN,Dawn? See how this works? Buizel has its own unique style.its own battle rhythm! A Trainer's task is to discover that unique style and help their Pokémon develop it! 
10,35,316,DAWN,I think I'm really starting to get this. 
10,35,317,LUCIAN,"All right, Buizel. Finish with Water g*n! "
10,35,318,BUIZEL,[WATER g*n MOVE] 
10,35,319,JAMES,"Not to be a spoilsport, but you promised my bottlecaps - back with interest! - "
10,35,320,JESSIE,I lied. 
10,35,321,MEOWTH,I should have bet money on that answer! 
10,35,322,JESSIE,We're blasting off again! 
10,35,323,DAWN,"Wow, Buizel, you were awesome! "
10,35,324,BUIZEL,[PLEASED]

10,35,326,DAWN,"You don't want to battle Lucian again, do you? "
10,35,327,LUCIAN,"I'd love to! Please, Dawn, may I? "
10,35,328,DAWN,Sure! 
10,35,329,LUCIAN,I'll use Bronzong again. Now! Gyro Ball! 
10,35,330,BRONZONG,[GYRO BALL MOVE]

10,35,342,LUCIAN,"Bronzong, return! "
10,35,343,DAWN,Why? 
10,35,344,LUCIAN,I think that's just enough. 
10,35,345,LUCIAN,"So, although I can't say you were perfect, you did work with your Buizel much better then you had before! "
10,35,346,DAWN,"Gee, thanks! "
10,35,347,LUCIAN,I know you'll become much stronger in the future. I look forward to seeing how you do. Farewell! 
10,35,348,DAWN,"Thank you so much,Lucian. Bye! "
10,35,349,BROCK,What an amazing meeting. And what a great guy! 
10,35,350,ASH,"Yeah, and one of these days I'm going to battle Lucian, too! "
10,35,351,DAWN,That's the spirit! Sounds like you're ready for win number two! 
10,35,352,ASH,You bet! I'm going to get that second Sinnoh badge for sure! 
10,35,353,NARRATOR,"A chance encounter with Lucian and the Elite Four turns out to be a wonderful way for Dawn to deepen the relationship with her Buizel, while Ash's second Sinnoh battle challenge at the Eterna City Gym is coming up faster than ever, so stay tuned! TO BE CONTINUED.."

10,34,17,"ASH, BROCK, DAWN",Buizel? 
10,34,18,OLDER MAN,"It dragged away my fishing rod, and my Zigzagoon got knocked out! That thing sure was scary. "
10,34,19,ASH,It sounds that way! 
10,34,20,OLDER MAN,"Anyway, I've got to go. But I wouldn't go fishing if I were you! "
10,34,21,ASH,"I've got to check out that Buizel! Come on guys, let's go fishing! "

10,34,23,NARRATOR,"Rumors of a strong Buizel are much too exciting for our heroes to ignore, and so it appears the Eterna City Gym will have to wait a little bit longer. "
10,34,24,ASH,Man. I'm not getting any bites. 
10,34,25,DAWN,I've never seen a lure like that. 
10,34,26,ASH,"This? Cool, huh? I got this from Misty a long time ago! "
10,34,27,DAWN,Misty?

10,34,61,POKEDEX,"Buizel. The Sea Weasel Pokémon. It stores air in the sacs on its neck and uses them as floatation devices, and swims by spinning its two tails like a propeller. "
10,34,62,ASH,So that's the strong Buizel!

10,33,135,JESSIE,"Oh well, at least you can't accuse James of not knowing how to have a good time. So Meowth, what say you and I hit the finals f*ring on all fours? "
10,33,136,MEOWTH,What's that mean? 
10,33,137,JESSIE,Your vocal stylings were second to none but with the stiff competition we need a bit more kick! That's it! That one thing you do the best! 
10,33,138,MEOWTH,And what's that? 
10,33,139,JESSIE,Oh come on! Think! You know... 
10,33,140,MEOWTH,Know what? 
10,33,141,JESSIE,Perfect! Super Sunflora! 
10,33,142,MEOWTH,Of course! I guess I have gotten rave reviews. 
10,33,143,JESSIE,With this look and that voice it'll be you and me and the Egg makes three! 
10,33,144,MEOWTH,And don't forget that Pokémon Eggs make a terrific gift for the Boss! 
10,33,145,MEOWTH,"With an Egg bunkmate, he'll sleep like a baby from dusk 'til dawn! Waking up with a happy yawn! "
10,33,146,JESSIE,Cut! Cut! You know we can't just haul off and give the Boss an unhatched and unproven Egg without first knowing what lurks within its shell! 
10,33,147,MEOWTH,"Uh, I do? "
10,33,148,JESSIE,If we apply a bit of strategic thinking and use patience we may end up with a Pokémon with real pizzazz! 
10,33,149,JESSIE,Now that would be a glorious gift worth giving! 
10,33,150,JESSIE,This one's worth the wait! 
10,33,151,MEOWTH,"But don't forget that old saying ""an Egg in the hand is worth two Pokémon in the bush."" "
10,33,152,JESSIE,Please! You think an Egg is going to make us richer than a legendary Sinnoh superstar Pokémon? 
10,33,153,MEOWTH,"Well, when you put it that way, I guess we could take a sh*t with some of that patience jazz. "
10,33,154,JESSIE,"Goody. We won't blow it. And before you know it, we'll be rich! "
10,33,155,RHONDA,"It's now time for our finals! And here are the incredible Pokémon and their trainers who have made it to the last round! We wish them the best of luck, though they're all winners already! "
10,33,156,DAWN,Oh man. Both Ash and Brock made it! 
10,33,157,DAWN,Don't worry Piplup. We'll get in the finals next year! Yup! 
10,33,158,BROCK,"You know, I'm amazed we've gotten this far just doing Politoed! "
10,33,159,RHONDA,"Now, our first competitor in the final round is our defending champion, Chatot! "
10,33,160,PARTNER,"You know Chatot, everyone's tired of hearing the Jigglypuff song. "
10,33,161,CHATOT,Everyone? 
10,33,162,PARTNER,"Since it's the finals, something different this time? "
10,33,163,CHATOT,Something different! 
10,33,164,JESSIE,That's the same song! 
10,33,165,CROAGUNK,[IMITATING] 
10,33,166,JESSIE,"Well, I guess there's no accounting for lousy taste. - "
10,33,167,MEOWTH,Hey Jess. - 
10,33,168,JESSIE,Now what? 
10,33,169,MEOWTH,"We really don't need to win this silly thing, you know. "
10,33,170,JESSIE,What? 
10,33,171,MEOWTH,"First we make sure no one's looking then, we grab the Egg and lam on out of here fast! "
10,33,172,JESSIE,Yes! Brilliant! Oh no! Who's that? 
10,33,173,JESSIE,"My mistake! That looked just like a legendary Pokémon, but it's not. Isn't that a scream? "
10,33,174,JAMES,What are you doing? It's almost time for our turn in lights! 
10,33,175,JESSIE,"Cheese it! We've already ripped off the Egg, so let's blow this pop stand! "
10,33,176,RHONDA,"Uh, excuse me, Katharine Jessiburn! Where are you going anyway? "
10,33,177,JESSIE,"Oh, just taking a walk. "
10,33,178,BROCK,"Croagunk, what's wrong? - "
10,33,179,BROCK,The Egg is gone! - 
10,33,180,ASH,You're kidding! 
10,33,181,BROCK,I'll bet they've got the Egg! 
10,33,182,SUKIZO,Too unremarkable!

10,33,188,JESSIE,I'll piece you! Cloaking off! That growling of Growlithe once filled us with fear! 
10,33,189,JAMES,Though who growls louder is not all that clear. - 
10,33,190,JESSIE,On the wind - 
10,33,191,JAMES,Past the stars 
10,33,192,MEOWTH,And in your ear! 
10,33,193,JESSIE,Bringing chaos at a breakneck pace! 
10,33,194,JAMES,"Dashing hope, putting fear in its place! "
10,33,195,JESSIE,A rose by any other name's just as sweet! 
10,33,196,JAMES,"When everything's worse, our work is complete! And how much worse can it get? - "
10,33,197,JESSIE,Um Jessie! - 
10,33,198,JAMES,James! 
10,33,199,MEOWTH,"Meowth, now that's a name! "

10,33,214,ASH,"Team Rocket, come back here! "
10,33,215,JESSIE,Twerps are so naive! 
10,33,216,MEOWTH,And we've got to leave! 
10,33,217,JAMES,"But mark my words, if Mime' Jr. and I had stayed to the stony end, we would've won this Egg anyway! "
10,33,218,JAMES,"It's true! Wow! There is but one champ, and that champ is you! "
10,33,219,MIME JR.,[HAPPY] 
10,33,220,RHONDA,"We may be right in the middle of the Pokémon Dress-Up Contest, but when a big story like this breaks, we cover it! Without that Egg, this magnificent event has no happy ending, so you'd better stay tuned! "
10,33,221,ASH,"You won't get away! Pikachu, use Thunderbolt! "
10,33,222,BROCK,No wait! Using Thunderbolt could damage the Egg! 
10,33,223,ASH,"Yeah, you're right! Okay Staravia use Wing att*ck! "

10,33,244,JESSIE,But who's going to do the driving? 
10,33,245,RHONDA,"That Teeter Dance has affected Meowth's steering! I wonder why they decided to use Teeter Dance since it's a move that confuses everyone, except the one using it in the first place. "
10,33,246,JAMES,Don't ask! 
10,33,247,JESSIE,The Twerps are so far away they don't feel a thing! You and your pseudo psycho-lame-o-mimic macho!

10,32,26,ASH,And that means we're on the right track. So let's move! 
10,32,27,JESSIE,My aching feet. My aching manicure! 
10,32,28,JAMES,Oh well. At least my eyes are sleeping. 
10,32,29,MEOWTH,Hey cut the claptrap! Great things are straight ahead. I know it! 
10,32,30,JESSIE,How strange. It feels like we might just be sleepwalking ourselves right over a cliff! 
10,32,31,JAMES,It does! Like in those goofy cartoons I love so much! Augh! Watch your step! It's a doozy and over we go! 
10,32,32,MEOWTH,It's bad luck to talk like that! 
10,32,33,MEOWTH,"Haven't you boobs ever read those books that say thoughts are things, so watch your thinking? "
10,32,34,JESSIE,"It's a joke, swami! "
10,32,35,JAMES,It's not like we're in a cartoon silly.

10,32,72,ASH,Do you smell the Honey? 
10,32,73,PIKACHU,[AFFIRMATIVE]

10,32,109,BROCK,It's a dead end! 
10,32,110,ASH,We've got to go back. 
10,32,111,JESSIE,Well.so much for glue. We've been unstuck from the Twerps again! Not that it's hard in this place. 
10,32,112,JAMES,"True. Meowth, how could someone fit an Amber Castle way down here? "
10,32,113,MEOWTH,I've been smelling that Enchanted Honey since we firstset foot in this joint! This is where it's at! 
10,32,114,MEOWTH,"Look, we really don't need being stuck like glue to those stinking Twerps anymore! My nose knows that I'm locked on target! "
10,32,115,JESSIE,Lock on!

10,32,147,BROCK,Did you dig that? 
10,32,148,DAWN,Then that has to be why the Combee are so mad! 
10,32,149,JESSIE,That or perhaps they just don't like Twerps. 
10,32,150,JAMES,Besides I'm sure there's plenty of Honey to go around! 
10,32,151,MEOWTH,"For the Combee, you Twerps, and for us! "
10,32,152,CHERYL,You don't understand. We don't even know where the Honey is!

10,32,321,JAMES,But at least this time no one will know it's us! 
10,32,322,MEOWTH,"Hey kids, I'll make you a deal. You don't tell them, and I won't either! "
10,32,323,JESSIE,We're blasting off again! 
10,32,324,COMBEE,[RELIEVED] 
10,32,325,BROCK,That's great! Using the stickiness of the Honey to repair the castle walls is a great idea! 
10,32,326,ASH,"That way, even when the ice melts, the castle will still be fine! "
10,32,327,PIKACHU,[IMPRESSED] 
10,32,328,BROCK,Thanks you two! You both did a fine job!

10,32,333,PIKACHU,[PLEASED] 
10,32,334,BROCK,Of course! The perfect way to thank her for her help. 
10,32,335,CHERYL,"Oh, Vespiquen, thanks! "
10,32,336,CHERYL,"Look everyone, isn't it great? Have a taste. "
10,32,337,ASH,[EXCITED] 
10,32,338,ASH,Wow! 
10,32,339,BROCK,"Hey, now I know what sweetness really tastes like! "

10,32,341,CROAGUNK,[DISGUSTED] 
10,32,342,ASH,[LAUGHING] 
10,32,343,BROCK,"Things sure worked out perfectly, didn't they? "
10,32,344,CHERYL,"They sure did, and I owe a big thanks to all to you! "
10,32,345,BROCK,I've got it! 
10,32,346,BROCK,"I'll be a treasure hunter! You and me, on the hunt, searching for new ways to show our treasured love to the whole world! "
10,32,347,CHERYL,"Look, a Beedrill! "
10,32,348,CHERYL,"My grandfather always said if you see a Beedrill, that means you have to travel alone! "
10,32,349,CHERYL,"Goodbye everyone, and take good care! "
10,32,350,BROCK,Farewell my sweetest of all sweets. 
10,32,351,DAWN,You take good care! 
10,32,352,PIKACHU,[CALLING] 
10,32,353,ASH,You know? Seeing someone like Cheryl finding her dream'sgot me even more psyched to find mine! 
10,32,354,NARRATOR,"It appears that going after the dreams of a lifetime are what our heroes are all about, and Ash's next one just happens to be waiting patiently for him at the Eterna City Gym! Guess what? We'll be there, too! "
10,32,355,JAMES,Why didn't somebody tell me Honey is for internal use only? 
10,32,356,JESSIE,What I wouldn't give for a shower! 
10,32,357,MEOWTH,"Better get those Honey-soaked clothes off, and quick! - "
10,32,358,JAMES,Now? - 
10,32,359,JESSIE,No! TO BE CONTINUED..
10,31,0,NARRATOR,"Traveling through Eterna Forest, our heroes came across Cheryl, a treasure hunter in search of the Amber Castle, which is said to contain the powerful Enchanted Honey! "
10,31,1,NARRATOR,"Cheryl's plan was to catch a Burmy and evolve it into a Mothim who could lead her to the Castle, which then became Team Rocket's plan as well! A fierce battle ensued, during which our heroes provided able assistance in returning the previously mild-mannered Burmy to its rightful owner. And it was precisely this fierce battling that allowed Cheryl's plan to come to fruition; causing her Burmy to evolve into the Mothim she so desired! Soon after, Mothim seemed to sense something and quickly took off, with Cheryl and our heroes in hot pursuit!

10,31,4,ASH,Mothim's up on that tree! 
10,31,5,CHERYL,Then that means we must've finally discovered the Enchanted Honey! 
10,31,6,DAWN,Hold on. This place looks awfully familiar to me... 
10,31,7,ASH,"You're right! Cheryl, isn't that the tree you put the Honey on before? "
10,31,8,CHERYL,"Well, what do you know! Small world isn't it? "
10,31,9,BROCK,It's getting late. Why don't we pick up on this tomorrow? 
10,31,10,NARRATOR,"Good advice, Brock. Perhaps a good night's sleep is just what everyone needs, as Eterna Forest is a big place, and finding the Enchanted Honey is looking like an even bigger job! "
10,31,11,MOTHIM,[EXCITED] 
10,31,12,CHERYL,"My Mothim seems to be so excited about something this morning, and there's no doubt in my mind it's got to be about the Enchanted Honey! "
10,31,13,MOTHIM,[EAGER] 
10,31,14,ASH,So let's get moving! 
10,31,15,PIKACHU,[AGREEING] 
10,31,16,CHERYL,Oh dear! Oh my!

10,31,18,CHERYL,Sure! I'm doing just fine! 
10,31,19,DAWN,Fine? Sure could've fooled me. 
10,31,20,DAWN,I'll say one thing.she sure knows how to make the best out of an awkward moment!

10,31,27,CHERYL,Things just got a bit out of control. 
10,31,28,BROCK,"Yeah, but it was fun. "

10,31,30,CHERYL,That's Mothim's cry!

10,31,37,GLOOM,[SURPRISED] 
10,31,38,DAWN,Who's that Pokémon? 
10,31,39,GARDENIA,"It's Gloom, the Weed Pokémon! It gives off a powerful aroma that can cause those who smell it to faint from two miles away! "
10,31,40,GLOOM,[GREETING] 
10,31,41,DAWN,Wow! That must be a strong smell.

10,31,44,GLOOM,[FRIGHTENED] 
10,31,45,BROCK,That's got to be the worst stench ever! 
10,31,46,CHERYL,"A Gloom secretes nectar too, so I guess poor Mothim just made a mistake! "
10,31,47,"PIKACHU, TURTWIG",[REVOLTED] 
10,31,48,GARDENIA,"Aw! I really wanted to catch it, but too late! "
10,31,49,GARDENIA,"You're a cutie, too! "
10,31,50,ASH,Uh. 
10,31,51,GARDENIA,"Hey, is this your Turtwig? "
10,31,52,ASH,Yup! 
10,31,53,GARDENIA,What a great Pokémon! 
10,31,54,ASH,"You're right, and thanks! I'm Ash, and it's nice to meet you! See, Turtwig and I are training hard to get ready for my Eterna Gym Battle, and are we psyched! "
10,31,55,GARDENIA,My name's Gardenia! I'm really into getting myself Grass-type Pokémon. That's why I came out here! 
10,31,56,BROCK,I'm Brock and I'm sure nothing would chase away my gloom but to search for your Gloom together! 
10,31,57,BROCK,Or not.your call. 
10,31,58,CROAGUNK,[CHUCKLING] 
10,31,59,GARDENIA,Hey Ash! I know! 
10,31,60,GARDENIA,Let's you and I have a battle! Yeah! Sound good? 
10,31,61,ASH,That sounds good to me! 
10,31,62,DAWN,"But, Ash, we're right in the middle of our search! "
10,31,63,CHERYL,It's all right. I think it'd be fun! 
10,31,64,CHERYL,You go right ahead and have yourselves a nice time! 
10,31,65,ASH,Thanks Cheryl. That's great! 
10,31,66,GARDENIA,"I'll use my Cherubi to start off. And now that I think of it, Eterna City Gym Leader is a Grass-type Trainer as well! "
10,31,67,ASH,Then that means having a battle with you right now's going to be awesome training! 
10,31,68,JAMES,"Although occasionally draining, it appears the best way to procure Enchanted Honey is to stick to the Twerps like glue! "
10,31,69,JESSIE,"If you had stuck to them like glue, we wouldn't be wandering aimlessly trying to fix being Twerp-less and Honey-less! "
10,31,70,MEOWTH,"The Twerps have to be here somewhere, so we'll find them! "

10,31,131,ASH,You were just great! 
10,31,132,BROCK,"Gardenia's Turtwig didn't move around much, but when it did, it was fast! "
10,31,133,BROCK,"I'd say, over all it was faster than Ash's Turtwig. "
10,31,134,ASH,"I'll show you fast... Gardenia, our battle isn't over just yet! "
10,31,135,GARDENIA,I know!

10,31,138,ASH,"I don't care how fast that Turtwig is, it can't match the speed of a flying Staravia! "
10,31,139,BROCK,"Flying types do have the advantage over Grass types, but... "

10,31,141,BROCK,There's more than one way to win a battle!

10,31,184,ASH,"You think? Special training, huh? "
10,31,185,PIKACHU,[OPTIMISTIC] 
10,31,186,GARDENIA,Enchanted Honey? Really? 
10,31,187,CHERYL,"Really! They say that the Honey's located in the Amber Castle, which is somewhere in this forest. "
10,31,188,GARDENIA,"Yeah, I remember hearing that too! "
10,31,189,CHERYL,Then it's true! 
10,31,190,GARDENIA,How come you're looking for the honey in the first place? 
10,31,191,CHERYL,My grandfather was a great treasure hunter .many long years ago. 
10,31,192,CHERYL,"But after all of his success, after all the wonderful treasures he managed to add to his collection, the only one he failed to find was the Enchanted Honey. "
10,31,193,CHERYL,So I swore I'd find it. I'm on a mission! 
10,31,194,GARDENIA,"I'd love to help you! If we all work together, we'll find it for sure! Now first off, you know that Enchanted Honey is made out of the nectar that - Combee gather, right? - "
10,31,195,CHERYL,Right! 
10,31,196,"GARDENIA, ","I come here to Eterna Forest a lot trying to capture Grass-type Pokémon. Well there's a place where Pomeg plants grow, and there's also a huge Combee Wall right there! "
10,31,197,CHERYL,What do you mean Combee Wall? 
10,31,198,"GARDENIA, ","A Combee Wall is where the Combee gather up all their nectar, but I've never seen one as big as this one before! I'm sure it's worth us going and having a look! And maybe there we can find a few clues! "
10,31,199,ASH,Yeah! That makes a lot of sense to me! That Enchanted Honey might just be near that Combee Wall! 
10,31,200,BROCK,"First thing in the morning, let's go! "
10,31,201,CHERYL,"Oh, I can't wait to see all those Pomeg flowers in full bloom! "
10,31,202,GARDENIA,"Hey, I know Eterna Forest like the back of my hand, so I'll take you there! "
10,31,203,CHERYL,I don't want to be a bother. 
10,31,204,GARDENIA,"Hey, come on! Don't forget, I came out of nowhere and begged Ash to battle me right? "
10,31,205,CHERYL,Of course! It's just like grandpa said! 
10,31,206,CHERYL,"Witness a good Pokémon battle, and something good always happens! "
10,31,207,MEOWTH,Being bandaged up stinks in this heat. 
10,31,208,JESSIE,Of course I know the Enchanted Honey is sweet! I may be stung but I'm not stupid! 
10,31,209,JAMES,Our present condition argues strongly against that assumption I'm afraid. 
10,31,210,JESSIE,"Look, mummy mouth. The fact remains that Enchanted Honey makes for enchanted bank accounts! "
10,31,211,MEOWTH,Zip it and listen! 
10,31,212,MEOWTH,I think I hear Twerps through the trees! 
10,31,213,"JAMES, JESSIE",Then be quiet please! 
10,31,214,GARDENIA,Hmm. I'm sure of it! We're getting close. Yes! I'm sure of it! 
10,31,215,CHERYL,"You'll let us know if you smell any Pomeg flowers, won't you Mothim? "
10,31,216,MOTHIM,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,31,217,JESSIE,"Get up, butter bandages! "
10,31,218,ASH,What's that? 
10,31,219,JESSIE,Listen! Is that confusion I hear? 
10,31,220,JAMES,"Through tape, it speaks loud and clear. - "
10,31,221,JESSIE,On the wind! - 
10,31,222,JAMES,Past the stars! 
10,31,223,MEOWTH,In your ear! 
10,31,224,JESSIE,Bringing chaos at a breakneck pace! 
10,31,225,JAMES,"Dashing hope, putting fear in its place! "
10,31,226,ESSIE,A rose by any other name's just as sweet! 
10,31,227,JAMES,"When everything's worse, our work is complete! - "
10,31,228,JESSIE,Jessie! - 
10,31,229,JAMES,And James! 
10,31,230,MEOWTH,"Meowth, that's a name! "
10,31,231,JESSIE,Putting the do-gooders in their place! 
10,31,232,JAMES,Team Rocket! 
10,31,233,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",We're in your face! 
10,31,234,JAMES,It's Mothim-catching time! Go Carnivine! 
10,31,235,"JAMES, CARNIVINE",[APPEARING] 
10,31,236,GARDENIA,You gorgeous Grass type! 
10,31,237,MEOWTH,What a wack! 
10,31,238,GARDENIA,You raised it so well! 
10,31,239,GARDENIA,How would you like to trade your Carnivine for - my Bellossom? - 
10,31,240,JAMES,"No, thank you! "
10,31,241,GARDENIA,"All right. In that case, how about my Vileplume? "
10,31,242,"JAMES,CARNIVINE",I'm tied up at the moment. Could you come back later? 
10,31,243,GARDENIA,Come on! The least you can do is show your face! There!

10,30,64,DAWN,"But, what makes you think you can find - that Honey way out here? - "
10,30,65,CHERYL,Look at this. 
10,30,66,DAWN,It's- it's some kind of map. 
10,30,67,CHERYL,"That's right! This makes it all possible, because it's a map of the Eterna Forest! "
10,30,68,CHERYL,And this X marks where I'm headed. - 
10,30,69,CHERYL,It's the Amber Castle! - 
10,30,70,ASH,"Whoa, a castle? "
10,30,71,CHERYL,It's a secret castlethat no one's ever been to yet... And that's where the Enchanted Honey is rumored to be!

10,30,88,DAWN,"But wait! If you need a Mothim, why don't you just go out and catch a Mothim in the first place? "
10,30,89,CHERYL,"My grandfather always used to say: ""All roads begin with Burmy."" I've caught three Burny so far, but... "

10,30,110,DAWN,Burmy! But how? 
10,30,111,BROCK,A Bug-type Pokémon like Burmy should be really strong against Turtwig who's a Grass type... 
10,30,112,DAWN,That means Burmy's really weak! Now what do we do? 
10,30,113,PIKACHU,[CONCERNED]

10,30,212,DAWN,"So, did your grandfather ever try and find the Enchanted Honey? "
10,30,213,CHERYL,"Yes. You see, that's why I took it on for my very first challenge as a treasure hunter! "
10,30,214,BROCK,Now I understand. 
10,30,215,CHERYL,"I thought, after carefully going over this map, that there was no doubt the Amber Castle containing the Enchanted Honey was here, right here in the Eterna Forest, now I don't know. "
10,30,216,ASH,"Hey, things will be fine! "
10,30,217,DAWN,You'll find the Enchanted Honey here for sure! 
10,30,218,BROCK,"And don't forget: We're here to help you look! So, please, cheer up! "

10,30,260,WOBBUFFET,[CONFUSED] 
10,30,261,JESSIE,I think it's time for a little talk! 
10,30,262,JESSIE,"Now look! If you don't evolve now, you'll regret it for the rest of your leafy life! "
10,30,263,JAMES,Stop! You're frightening the poor Pokémon!

10,29,168,DAWN,Excuse me? You just love talking about yourself don't you? 
10,29,169,BROCK,Come on remember in tag battles both partners have to be totally in sync! 
10,29,170,DAWN,I was trying to get in sync but he wouldn't let me! - 
10,29,171,ASH,So this is all my fault? - 
10,29,172,DAWN,If the shoe fits. 
10,29,173,ASH,"I told you to take care of the Fire type... and, you said ""no need to worry"" like you always do but Piplup blew it! "
10,29,174,DAWN,My Piplup took the hit and was just getting up when a certain Turtwig of yours got in the way! 
10,29,175,ASH,That's because Piplup was trying to cut in front! 
10,29,176,DAWN,Your Turtwig was the one who went out of turn! 
10,29,177,ASH,Look at what happened to poor Turtwig! 
10,29,178,DAWN,Look at what happened to poor Piplup 
10,29,179,BROCK,"All of this arguing can sure work up an appetite, so I'll make something good to eat! "

10,29,193,BROCK,Now that's just what I wanted to see from you two! Excellent! And of course since your Pokémon had the sense to make up it seems only logical their trainers should too! 
10,29,194,ASH,You want me to what?

10,29,204,DAWN,I'd love to! - 
10,29,205,ASH,Great! You're in! 
10,29,206,ASH,"Remember, Quilava's a Fire type so that means your Water-type Piplup's totally got the advantage! "
10,29,207,DAWN,"And being a Grass-type, Turtwig's got the advantage against Croconaw! "
10,29,208,ASH,"Whoa, those guys won't know what hit them! "

10,28,140,MEOWTH,Let's say the Boss is having one of those nightmares that's so scary it pops your eyes open! But the room's so dark and creepy that he just can't snap out of his night fright! When suddenly. 
10,28,141,MEOWTH,"Thanks to our generosity, Ampharos will shine the light of truth and chase away all his fears! "
10,28,142,MEOWTH,"And knowing because of us he'll never be afraid of the Boogeyman again, he'll say. ""Thanks to Meowth and friends, I'll never ever be sleepless in Boss land!"" "

10,28,150,MARNIE,You think so? 
10,28,151,KARSTEN,It could be quite dangerous to flyback - through those dark clouds! - 
10,28,152,MARNIE,You're right! 
10,28,153,KARSTEN,Right! Let's get going then. 
10,28,154,MARNIE,Who just did that? 
10,28,155,JESSIE,Listen! Is that father and daughter I hear? 
10,28,156,JAMES,It was their talk of lunch that caught my ear. - 
10,28,157,JESSIE,On the wind! -

10,28,175,JESSIE,What's up with that? 
10,28,176,JAMES,Yes! We were supposed to be insulated! 
10,28,177,MEOWTH,We used to have plenty of money for that stuff but now our dough is invested in Jessie's hair and finger nails. 
10,28,178,"JESSIE, JAMES",With interest.

10,28,193,DAWN,Valley Windworks? 
10,28,194,BROCK,Isn't that where Marnie went to take her father's lunch? 
10,28,195,PAIGE,Mommy you don't think something bad happened? 
10,28,196,NURSE JOY,Don't worry! Mommy will go there and take a look. -

10,28,230,"KARSTEN, NURSE JOY",What? - 
10,28,231,MARNIE,What do we do? 
10,28,232,KARSTEN,"Well, first let's track the pattern of that last wind gust. They had to have been blown in the vicinity of those mountains! "
10,28,233,DAWN,"But, that's so far! "
10,28,234,KARSTEN,"It appears the winds are all headed the same way, - and there will be more. - "

10,27,288,MARIAN,That impressive Whirlpool now has Prinplup surrounded! 
10,27,289,KENNY,"Hey, that's great you learned Whirlpool, but don't expect it to do much against a Water type! "
10,27,290,ASH,"Man. if it doesn't do anything, no way it'll be her last move... "
10,27,291,BROCK,Right! But Kenny's losing points! That must mean the judges really liked the looks and timing of Piplup's Whirlpool!

10,27,302,ASH,Pretty cool thinking. 
10,27,303,BROCK,"Good strategy, all right! Using Mist to hide. They're trying to wear Piplup down so Piplup runs out of patience! "

10,26,80,JESSIE,Now! Presenting your fave winning Coordinator! 
10,26,81,MEOWTH,"As soon as she puts those glasses on, she's like a whole new nuthead! "
10,26,82,JAMES,But this time she'll be a successful nuthead! 
10,26,83,JESSIE,"I'll ignore Meowth's drivel, because I'm psyched! "
10,26,84,JAMES,And which Pokémon will you be psyched with? 
10,26,85,JESSIE,The answer to that question is but an arm's length away! Follow my lead. 
10,26,86,JESSIE,Can't you see the terrain is teeming with tempting Pokémon? 
10,26,87,JAMES,Your point? 
10,26,88,JESSIE,"What do I have to do, draw you a map? "
10,26,89,SEVIPER,[APPEARING]

10,26,94,JAMES,Jessie's right 
10,26,95,MEOWTH,We can't forget 
10,26,96,DAWN,Kenny left from Twinleaf Town to start on his journey before I did! 
10,26,97,DAWN,"We've known each other since nursery school, and we used to play together a lot! "
10,26,98,DAWN,I'm trying to remember your first Pokémon. 
10,26,99,KENNY,I'll show you! 
10,26,100,DAWN,[SURPRISED]

10,26,102,PRINPLUP,[APPEARING] 
10,26,103,DAWN,"Wow, a Prinplup! "
10,26,104,ASH,Then that means you chose a Piplup for your starter Pokémon. 
10,26,105,POKEDEX,"Prinplup. The Penguin Pokémon, and the evolved form of Piplup. One blow from its wings is strong enough to knock down trees. "
10,26,106,PIPLUP,[GREETING]

10,26,110,KENNY,"Uh sorry, but sometimes Prinplup gets a little freaked out if anyone gets in its space! "
10,26,111,KENNY,I'm the only one Prinplup doesn't have a problem with. 
10,26,112,PRINPLUP,[SCOFF]

10,26,114,PRINPLUP,[SNEER] 
10,26,115,PIPLUP,[STRUGGLING] 
10,26,116,ASH,They're acting just like rivals! 
10,26,117,PIKACHU,[AGREEMENT] 
10,26,118,DAWN,"Oh, why not just get along? "
10,26,119,BROCK,"Well, they're both Penguin Pokémon, remember, and tempers at times can get pretty hot. "
10,26,120,BROCK,Prinplup in particular aren't thrilled being with others! 
10,26,121,KENNY,I saw you using Piplup over at the Jubilife Contest. Were you copying me? 
10,26,122,DAWN,"I wouldn't copy you ever! Piplup and I were made for each other. Isn't that right, sweetie? "
10,26,123,PIPLUP,[AGREEMENT] 
10,26,124,DAWN,You were at the Jubilife Contest? Were you competing or just watching? 
10,26,125,KENNY,"Uh, excuse me my match was on TV, so why weren't you watching? "
10,26,126,DAWN,Guess I was busy! 
10,26,127,DAWN,"Wow, I can't see you as a Coordinator! "
10,26,128,KENNY,"That? Well, unlike you, I've already made it to the finals! "
10,26,129,DAWN,"Wow, you did? Amazing! "
10,26,130,KENNY,"It was at the contest right before Jubilife City, and I thought I had my first ribbon... "
10,26,131,KENNY,But then I came up against an opponent so powerful I didn't have a chance! 
10,26,132,KENNY,"She had a Glameow, and her name was Zoey "
10,26,133,KENNY,Zoey b*at you as well. Remember? 
10,26,134,DAWN,So Zoey b*at both of us! 
10,26,135,PIPLUP,[CURIOUS] 
10,26,136,DAWN,"At the Jubilife Contest, Zoey told me she had just one ribbon. So she must've won that one off of you! "
10,26,137,ASH,I think Zoey was really strong! 
10,26,138,PIKACHU,[AGREEMENT] 
10,26,139,BROCK,She had great combinations to spare! 
10,26,140,KENNY,Are you competing here? 
10,26,141,DAWN,"No, not this time! You see, Ash is aiming to win the Sinnoh League and Brock's a Pokémon breeder! "
10,26,142,KENNY,"But you were in Jubilife, right? "
10,26,143,ASH,"I had some fun with contests, but no doubt it's Gym battles for me! "
10,26,144,KENNY,"So you guys first hooked up in Jubilife, then? "
10,26,145,DAWN,"Before that. We first met after I rescued Ash's Pikachu for him, and later I watched Ash battle at the Oreburgh Gym two whole times before he finally earned his first badge in Sinnoh! - "
10,26,146,ASH,What's up? - 
10,26,147,KENNY,"Nothing. See, I'm sure you've got your stories, but they don't hold a candle to my Dawn ones! "
10,26,148,DAWN,You wouldn't dare! 
10,26,149,KENNY,"When it comes to stories, I've got tons of them! - "
10,26,150,ASH,Like what? - 
10,26,151,BROCK,"Hey, we're all ears! "
10,26,152,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
10,26,153,DAWN,"Kenny, do you have to? "
10,26,154,KENNY,"They'll love it! One time, Dawn's mom made her get this haircut that she couldn't stand. So Dawn tried to cut it herself! You can't believe how it turned out. She looked just like a Chimchar! "
10,26,155,ASH,A Chimchar?[SHOCKED] 
10,26,156,ASH,[RESTRAINED] 
10,26,157,ASH,[LAUGHING] 
10,26,158,DAWN,Could we all try and grow up? That happened way way back in nursery school! 
10,26,159,KENNY,"Oh yeah! Man, how about the play we did right around the same time? "
10,26,160,KENNY,What a sneeze what a riot! 
10,26,161,ASH,[RESTRAINED] 
10,26,162,PIPLUP ,[RESTRAINED] 
10,26,163,DAWN,Oh great! Laugh at a little girl! 
10,26,164,KENNY,And then there was the time she came to school in her pajamas... 
10,26,165,KENNY,"She was wearing two different shoes, and you'll never guess what she said! "
10,26,166,ASH,"""No need to worry,"" right? "
10,26,167,KENNY,"Hey, how did you know? "
10,26,168,ASH,"Well, let's say I've heard it before "
10,26,169,PIKACHU,[AMUSED] 
10,26,170,BROCK,She's been saying that since day one! 
10,26,171,DAWN,I have had it! 
10,26,172,DAWN,"If you think I'm the way I was back then, you've got another think coming! I'll show you a real Pokémon battle! "
10,26,173,PIPLUP,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,26,174,KENNY,What I want is a battle against that Pikachu! 
10,26,175,ASH,"What, with me? "
10,26,176,PIKACHU,[CONFUSED] 
10,26,177,DAWN,Did you hear what I said or not? 
10,26,178,PIPLUP,[INDIGNANT]

10,26,183,ASH,"Come on, Dawn, he challenged me, and I'm doing it! "
10,26,184,PIKACHU,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,26,185,KENNY,Let's keep it simple. One on one! 
10,26,186,ASH,Right! 
10,26,187,DAWN,An Electric type like Pikachu should have the advantage over Water type Prinplup! 
10,26,188,BROCK,"We'll see, we'll see. Whatever happens, it ought to be a real eye-opener! "
10,26,189,BROCK,That Prinplup sure seems confident! 
10,26,190,KENNY,"Okay, Ash, you can have the first move! "
10,26,191,ASH,Then you can get a good look at my Pikachu and an awesome Thunderbolt! 
10,26,192,PIKACHU,[THUNDERBOLT MOVE] 
10,26,193,KENNY,Metal Claw! 
10,26,194,PRINPLUP,[METAL CLAW MOVE] 
10,26,195,PRINPLUP,[EFFORT] 
10,26,196,ASH,No way! 
10,26,197,DAWN,Prinplup absorbed the att*ck! 
10,26,198,PRINPLUP,[EFFORT] 
10,26,199,PIKACHU,[SHOCKED] 
10,26,200,ASH,Prinplup sent the Thunderbolt right back! 
10,26,201,DAWN,"But how? I mean, Prinplup looks fine! "
10,26,202,BROCK,"Metal Claw's a Steel-type move, and if it's really powerful, it can be used to defend against Electric att*cks! "
10,26,203,PRINPLUP,[CONFIDENT] 
10,26,204,BROCK,And to think Thunderbolt is the move that made Pikachu famous. 
10,26,205,DAWN,"That Prinplup is just so strong, I can see why Kenny made it all the way to the final round... "
10,26,206,KENNY,"Now, my turn! Drill Peck, let's go! "
10,26,207,PRINPLUP,[DRILL PECK MOVE] 
10,26,208,ASH,"Heads up, Pikachu! "
10,26,209,PIKACHU,[AFFIRMATIVE]

10,26,214,PRINPLUP,[CONFUSED] 
10,26,215,KENNY,Oh man! 
10,26,216,DAWN,There's that move again! 
10,26,217,PIKACHU,[EFFORT] 
10,26,218,ASH,Now use Iron Tail! 
10,26,219,PIKACHU,[IRON TAIL MOVE] 
10,26,220,PRINPLUP,[IMPACT] 
10,26,221,KENNY,"Prinplup, Bubble Beam, now! "
10,26,222,PRINPLUP,[BUBBLE BEAM MOVE] 
10,26,223,PRINPLUP,[EFFORT] 
10,26,224,KENNY,Way to go! 
10,26,225,PRINPLUP,[CONFIDENT] 
10,26,226,PIKACHU,[EFFORT] 
10,26,227,ASH,"Good stuff, Kenny, but we're not done yet! "
10,26,228,DAWN,"Wow, what a way to use Bubble Beam! "
10,26,229,PIPLUP,[AMAZED] 
10,26,230,BROCK,Using moves in a unique way is perfect for a contest Coordinator 
10,26,231,JAMES,That unidentified Twerp's really giving the well-known Twerp a run for his mad money! 
10,26,232,MEOWTH,"Well, that's a Prinplup, and it's a piece of work! "
10,26,233,PIKACHU,[IRON TAIL MOVE] 
10,26,234,PRINPLUP,[METAL CLAW MOVE] 
10,26,235,MEOWTH,Poetry in motion! 
10,26,236,PIKACHU,[IRON TAIL MOVE] 
10,26,237,JAMES,What a power supply! 
10,26,238,MEOWTH,I got me a notion. 
10,26,239,JAMES,As do 
10,26,240,I WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,26,241,MIME JR,[ECHOING] 
10,26,242,MEOWTH,"We need to get that dynamo for Jess! Okay, guys, you ready? "
10,26,243,SEVIPER,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,26,244,JAMES,Go and ruffle Prinplup's feathers with Haze! 
10,26,245,SEVIPER,[HAZE MOVE] 
10,26,246,ASH,What the... 
10,26,247,KENNY,Where did that come from? 
10,26,248,ASH,Staravia! Come out and use Gust! 
10,26,249,STARAVIA,[GUST MOVE] 
10,26,250,SEVIPER,[MENACING][STRUGGLING]

10,26,253,ASH,Team Rocket? 
10,26,254,JAMES,Don't blame us if you were too quick on the draw with that hasty Haze! 
10,26,255,KENNY,"I don't know what you're doing, but let go of Prinplup! "
10,26,256,BROCK,"Hey, where's Jessie? "
10,26,257,JAMES,"Getting her nails done, if you don't mind! "
10,26,258,DAWN,Nails done? 
10,26,259,KENNY,"Hey, Prinplup, with your power you can get out of that hold! "
10,26,260,PRINPLUP,[STRUGGLING][MENACING] 
10,26,261,MEOWTH,"Sorry to spoil the Twerp party, but Dustox's Poison Sting just sucked the wind out of Prinplup's sails super big time! "
10,26,262,DUSTOX,[TAUNTING] 
10,26,263,KENNY,What? Don't worry! I'm getting you out of there! 
10,26,264,JAMES,Not if they have anything to say about it! 
10,26,265,JAMES,"Cacnea, Pin m*ssile, and Carnivine, b*llet Seed, and I'm taking a nap. "
10,26,266,ASH,Look out! - 
10,26,267,ASH,You okay? - 
10,26,268,DAWN,Kenny? 
10,26,269,KENNY,Yeah who are those guys? 
10,26,270,DAWN,They're bad. They're always trying to steal Pokémon from us! 
10,26,271,JAMES,But we're so good at being bad! 
10,26,272,MEOWTH,"Whatever, let's just get them! "
10,26,273,JAMES,"Just one step closer, and Prinplup gets punked! "
10,26,274,SEVIPER,[THREATENING][STRUGGLING]

10,26,279,PIKACHU,[SURPRISED] 
10,26,280,ASH,You can't use Thunderbolt! 
10,26,281,ASH,It could really hurt Prinplup! 
10,26,282,BROCK,"Yeah. Prinplup used Metal Claw before to dodge, but not this time! "
10,26,283,PIKACHU,[FRUSTRATED] 
10,26,284,PIPLUP,[DETERMINED] 
10,26,285,JAMES,Now don't move! 
10,26,286,MEOWTH,It's time for us to be sliding on out of here! 
10,26,287,KENNY,Oh no! 
10,26,288,PIPLUP,[ANGRY] 
10,26,289,JAMES,Why don't we go for broke? 
10,26,290,MEOWTH,Yeah! 
10,26,291,MEOWTH,Now would be a good time to make you dumb Twerps blast off for a change!

10,26,297,PIPLUP,[DETERMINED] 
10,26,298,ASH,What's that? 
10,26,299,PIKACHU,[CURIOUS] 
10,26,300,DAWN,That looked like Bide 
10,26,301,BROCK,I don't think so the flash was different! 
10,26,302,PIPLUP,[WHIRLPOOL MOVE] 
10,26,303,DAWN,"Piplup, what is that? "
10,26,304,JAMES,[SHOCKED] 
10,26,305,MEOWTH,I hate Twerp tricks! 
10,26,306,BROCK,That must be a new move! 
10,26,307,ASH,You think? 
10,26,308,KENNY,It's Whirlpool! 
10,26,309,KENNY,It traps your opponent in a whirlpool and causes them damage over and over! 
10,26,310,DAWN,"Whirlpool! That sounds like just what we need! All right, Piplup, use Whirlpool! "
10,26,311,PIPLUP,[WHIRLPOOL MOVE]

10,26,320,ASH,"Hey look, Prinplup's just fine! "
10,26,321,BROCK,It must be that the intense energy from Piplup's Whirlpool is adding to Prinplup's power! 
10,26,322,PIPLUP,[CHEERFUL] 
10,26,323,PRINPLUP,[GRATEFUL] 
10,26,324,JAMES,Perhaps a stealthful exit!

10,26,338,ASH,"Piplup, you were great! "
10,26,339,PIKACHU,[AGREEMENT] 
10,26,340,DAWN,Learning a brand-new move right before our next contest is an awesome thing to do! 
10,26,341,KENNY,"And thanks to you, Prinplup's just fine! "
10,26,342,PIPLUP,[PROUD] / [FRANTIC] 
10,26,343,PIPLUP,[PAINED] 
10,26,344,BROCK,"Piplup, are you hurt? "
10,26,345,DAWN,"No need to worry, right? "
10,26,346,ASH,"Piplup, I can't wait to watch you two in the contest. You're gonna be great! "
10,26,347,PIKACHU,[AGREEMENT] 
10,26,348,PIPLUP,[BASHFUL] 
10,26,349,JAMES,Have mercy!

10,26,355,SEVIPER,[CONCERNED] 
10,26,356,DUSTOX,[CONCERNED] 
10,26,357,JESSIE,"But of course, I'm going to have to train you to be wild, beautiful, and gorgeous, just like I am! "
10,26,358,JESSIE,"Soon as my nails dry, that is! "
10,26,359,DUSTOX,[CONFUSED] 
10,26,360,KENNY,Prinplup! 
10,26,361,PRINPLUP,[GREETING] 
10,26,362,NURSE JOY,Prinplup is feeling just fine now! You two will be all set for the contest! 
10,26,363,KENNY,Thanks so much! 
10,26,364,DAWN,"Wow, that's a relief! Good for you! "
10,26,365,KENNY,"Well, you better just watch out, Dawn, because we're going to get ourselves that contest ribbon, see? You might as well accept it! "
10,26,366,DAWN,"Yeah? Afraid not. You're the one who'd better watch out, see? "
10,26,367,ASH,That's what I want to hear! 
10,26,368,BROCK,Nothing like a couple lifelong rivals! Tomorrow's going to be something! 
10,26,369,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
10,26,370,MARIAN,"Miles and miles of beautiful scented flowers, intermingling with miles and miles of excited Pokémon and their Coordinators, can mean only one thing: it's time for the Floaroma Town Pokémon Contest! "

10,26,373,BROCK,Are you two ready to cheer? 
10,26,374,PIKACHU,[CHEERING] 
10,26,375,JAMES,Hope Seviper knows what's at stake! 
10,26,376,MEOWTH,"Namely, if Jessie loses this time, she's going to burn us at the stake. "
10,26,377,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,26,378,JAMES,[WORRIED] 
10,26,379,JAMES,We'll be crispy around the edges. 
10,26,380,MEOWTH,Like burnt toast! 
10,26,381,MARIAN,"As you all undoubtedly know, the Coordinator who wins at five contest locations throughout the Sinnoh region and gathers five contest ribbons will then be able to stand proudly on the stage to compete at the prestigious Grand Festival! "
10,26,382,MARIAN,And here is one of those five spectacular ribbons for all to see. 
10,26,383,MARIAN,The fabulous Floaroma Ribbon! 
10,26,384,DAWN,"Hey, Kenny! "
10,26,385,DAWN,I'm so glad we made it!

10,26,387,KENNY,"Come on, that's crazy! "
10,26,388,DAWN,"Then what's the big deal, huh? "
10,26,389,KENNY,Nothing! 
10,26,390,DAWN,Don't you think I'm pretty? 
10,26,391,KENNY,"Now look, I'm not going easy on you! "

10,26,399,JOY,Thank you! Thanks so much! 
10,26,400,MARIAN,"Of course, you know me! Yes, I'm your humble emcee Marian! "
10,26,401,MARIAN,And now for the first round! Where Coordinators get to show their Pokémon in their best light! 
10,26,402,MARIAN,"So, let's get this show on the road! "

10,26,409,PACHIRISU,[EXCITED] 
10,26,410,DAWN,Oh no! 
10,26,411,MARIAN,Pachirisu's slipped!

10,26,415,PACHIRISU,[FLUSTERED] 
10,26,416,MARIAN,"Oh my, Pachirisu seems to be having a bit of trouble at the moment! "
10,26,417,PACHIRISU,[SCARED] 
10,26,418,DAWN,Pachirisu! It's all right! 
10,26,419,PIKACHU,[ENCOURAGING] 
10,26,420,BROCK,Oh no! I don't even think Pachirisu's able to hear Dawn's voice! 
10,26,421,ASH,"Pachirisu, calm down! "
10,26,422,PACHIRISU,[PANICKING] 
10,26,423,DAWN,That's it! 
10,26,424,NARRATOR,"Suddenly, it seems Pachirisu has run into some serious trouble! And just as suddenly, Dawn seems to have happily remembered something very important! Will whatever it is be enough to turn things around? TO BE CONTINUED.."
10,25,0,ASH,You mean like this? 
10,25,1,FORSYTHIA,"No, that's too fast! You're going to spill it! "
10,25,2,ASH,"Okay, then how about this? "
10,25,3,FORSYTHIA,That's too slow! You're going to burn it!

10,25,9,MEOWTH,And I think it's wafting from that big building over there!

10,25,18,NARRATOR,"It's a veritable feast for the eyes, ears, and noses, as our heroes finally have the chance to take in the floral splendor that is Floaroma Town, home of Dawn's next Pokémon Contest! "
10,25,19,OLD WOMAN,"Judging by your faces, I'd say this is your first time in Floaroma Town! "
10,25,20,DAWN,Yeah! We just arrived for the contest! It's so beautiful! 
10,25,21,OLD WOMAN,"Our trees and flowers are gorgeous. You'd never guess that many years ago, this paradise was once a barren wasteland! "
10,25,22,OLD WOMAN,"Everywhere you looked, the land was without beauty, and the sad and weary faces of the people of this town reflected the sorry state of affairs we found ourselves in. Many tried to plant flowers and trees, but "
10,25,23,OLD WOMAN,"Nothing seemed to want to grow, no matter what! "
10,25,24,OLD WOMAN,"But legend has it that one day, a beautiful woman climbed to the top of the hill to give thanks for nature's great beauty! "
10,25,25,OLD WOMAN,"And with that, it was like the flowers and trees couldn't wait to break through the earth and join forces with the woman to express their thanks as well! "
10,25,26,DAWN,What a beautiful story! 
10,25,27,BROCK,And so beautifully told. Thanks for sharing that! 
10,25,28,DAWN,"Yeah, thank you so very much! "
10,25,29,OLD WOMAN,"It is not only my pleasure but my privilege to be able to share such a wonderful story with you young people! I hope you won't forget it, and please have a wonderful stay in our town! "
10,25,30,DAWN,"Hey, what's that? "
10,25,31,DAWN,"Look, guys! This says they're going to have a Poffin cooking class today! "
10,25,32,ASH,Poffin? What's Poffin? 
10,25,33,DAWN,Now don't tell me you don't know what Poffins are! 
10,25,34,ASH,I won't have to if you tell me! 
10,25,35,DAWN,"All right, relax! "
10,25,36,DAWN,Poffins are a Pokémon snack that's made from tree berries! 
10,25,37,DAWN,"See, I always helped my mom when she made Poffins, so that would make me an expert! "
10,25,38,ASH,"So if Poffins are a Pokémon snack, that would make it like Hoenn region Pokéblock! "
10,25,39,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
10,25,40,BROCK,"Well, I guess it's like Pokéblock in a certain way, but I've heard Poffins are made from a different recipe. "
10,25,41,DAWN,"And not only do Poffins keep Pokémon super healthy, they keep them looking and feeling just great! "
10,25,42,DAWN,"Come on, wouldn't it be fun to take a Poffin cooking class, too? "
10,25,43,ASH,"You know, Brock, she might have a point! "
10,25,44,BROCK,I say yes!

10,25,52,ASH,"Uh, hello? We'd really like to take your Poffin cooking class now, please! "
10,25,53,DAWN,"Ash, keep it down! "
10,25,54,DAWN,I think you're scaring that Roserade out there! 
10,25,55,ROSERADE,[CONCERNED] 
10,25,56,ASH,Oops. My bad 
10,25,57,DAWN,Sorry about that! Just because he's loud now doesn't mean he's rude all the time!

10,25,59,ASH,Hey! Let's check out the Roserade. 
10,25,60,POKEDEX,"Roserade. The Bouquet Pokémon. Roserade is the evolved form of Roselia. It lures enemies with its sweet aroma, then att*cks with dancer-like elegance. "
10,25,61,ASH,So it evolves from Roselia! 
10,25,62,FORSYTHIA,Did you say you're here for the Poffin cooking class? 
10,25,63,ASH,Uh huh! 
10,25,64,FORSYTHIA,I made you wait! I'm terribly sorry. 
10,25,65,BROCK,Apologies are a waste of time! I would've happily waited until the end of time for just one fleeting but lovely glimpse of your radiant beauty! My blooming flower! 
10,25,66,FORSYTHIA,"Oh, thank you! How nice. "
10,25,67,BROCK,My I ask your name? 
10,25,68,FORSYTHIA,Forsythia. Hello! 
10,25,69,BROCK,"Forsythia. For one in the throes of such blossoming beauty, it's the perfect name! "
10,25,70,BROCK,"Ah, to stand in a field of flowers with you! "
10,25,71,BROCK,To stand anywhere! 
10,25,72,CROAGUNK,[LAUGHING] 
10,25,73,FORSYTHIA,"Very well, thenwon't the rest of you come inside, please? "
10,25,74,FORSYTHIA,"First, you put your berries in a pot of cold water. "
10,25,75,FORSYTHIA,"Then, you turn the heat up all the way while stirring nonstop! "
10,25,76,FORSYTHIA,"It's this constant stirring that gives Poffins their flavor, you see. Okay, is everyone with me so far? "
10,25,77,ASH,You bet! 
10,25,78,DAWN,That's that. Good! 
10,25,79,ASH,What are you messing with your Pokétch for? 
10,25,80,DAWN,"I'm just setting the timer! You have to be careful when you cook Poffins, because if you keep it on the heat too long, it'll burnbut if you don't keep it on the heat long enough, it won't cook down, see? "
10,25,81,FORSYTHIA,"It looks like you've done this before, correct? "
10,25,82,DAWN,"Yeah! When I was a kid, I always helped my mom in the kitchen! "
10,25,83,FORSYTHIA,"Oh, I think that's just great! Helping your mom. "
10,25,84,BROCK,"Hey! Not only did I help out my mom, but I helped out my dad! And all my brothers, too! And all of my sisters as well! "
10,25,85,CROAGUNK,[MENACING] 
10,25,86,BROCK,I got it. Can we move on to something else? 
10,25,87,CROAGUNK,[DISMISSIVE] 
10,25,88,DAWN,Time! 
10,25,89,BROCK,"So once it's fully cooked down, you pour it into the mold...check! "
10,25,90,FORSYTHIA,You've got to stir it faster! 
10,25,91,ASH,You mean like this? 
10,25,92,FORSYTHIA,"No, that's too fast! You're going to spill it! "
10,25,93,ASH,"Okay, then how about this? "
10,25,94,FORSYTHIA,That's too slow! You're going to burn it! 
10,25,95,ROSERADE,[FRUSTRATED] 
10,25,96,DAWN,My Poffins are good to go! 
10,25,97,ASH,And so are mine! 
10,25,98,FORSYTHIA,All right! Great! Then I guess it's gotta be snack time! 
10,25,99,DAWN,"Yeah! All right, everybody, come on out! "
10,25,100,PIPLUP,[APPEARING]

10,25,111,DAWN,"Wait! What's wrong? It's the recipe my mom made for her Glameow, and it got raves! "
10,25,112,BROCK,"All right! So, what do you think? "
10,25,113,SUDOWOODO,[HAPPY] 
10,25,114,CROAGUNK,[STOIC] 
10,25,115,STARAVIA,[EXCITED] 
10,25,116,FORSYTHIA,There's plenty to go around! 
10,25,117,STARAVIA,[HAPPY EATING] 
10,25,118,ASH,'Course nobody wants to eat any of mine. 
10,25,119,ROSERADE,[SURPRISED] 
10,25,120,ASH,So? I'll just eat them all myself! 
10,25,121,ASH,Yuck! 
10,25,122,FORSYTHIA,It's your first try! It takes a lot of practicing to make Poffins that truly taste good! 
10,25,123,PACHIRISU,[PROTESTING] 
10,25,124,ASH,Right... 
10,25,125,DAWN,Please? Give it another taste 
10,25,126,PACHIRISU,[EFFORT] 
10,25,127,DAWN,"Come on, everybody, I worked really hard on this! "
10,25,128,DAWN,Hey! 
10,25,129,JESSIE,"Meowth, be careful! If you start putting any old thing in your mouth, you'll get sick! "
10,25,130,MEOWTH,Soon as you stop having old things come out of yours. 
10,25,131,MEOWTH,That was delicious! I feel like I've gone to my grub reward in the sky! 
10,25,132,ASH,"Hey! So your Pokémon didn't like the Poffins, did they? "
10,25,133,FORSYTHIA,Pokémon all have different tastes! 
10,25,134,DAWN,Is that true? 
10,25,135,FORSYTHIA,"Of course! Just like people have all kinds of likes and dislikes, too! It's how you feel same with them! What was your mom's Pokémon? "
10,25,136,DAWN,It's a Glameow! 
10,25,137,FORSYTHIA,"Well, then,I'm certain your mother made her Poffins specifically for the Glameow! Maybe you should try a whole different approach for your Pokémon. "
10,25,138,DAWN,A different approach? 
10,25,139,FORSYTHIA,It's just a matter of trial and error until you find the best kind of Poffin for your Pokémon! 
10,25,140,FORSYTHIA,Then you'll be certain you're doing everything you can for them! 
10,25,141,DAWN,Great! 
10,25,142,JAMES,"So, as I see it, Sinnoh Poffins are prepared from only the choicest of berries! "
10,25,143,MEOWTH,Keep talking... 
10,25,144,JAMES,"Hey, so what's with that creepy closed-mouthed cackle? "
10,25,145,MEOWTH,The wheels are turning! 
10,25,146,JESSIE,"Pokéblock is oh so yesterday! With Poffins, dare I say we'll rule the world? "
10,25,147,JESSIE,Flush with financial abundance as well as culinary notoriety making dough that will make us real dough! - 
10,25,148,JAMES,Well said! - 
10,25,149,MEOWTH,If you're nuts! 
10,25,150,JESSIE,I mean we're going to get rich! 
10,25,151,JESSIE,It's Poffins or bust! 
10,25,152,JESSIE,Selling piles of Poffins are a must! 
10,25,153,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,25,154,MIME JR,[ECHOING] 
10,25,155,FORSYTHIA,You've all worked hard today. 
10,25,156,FORSYTHIA,So! Why don't we all relax a bit with a nice cup of tea? 
10,25,157,ROSERADE,[NERVOUS] 
10,25,158,ASH,"Man, for some reason Roserade's scared of me. "
10,25,159,DAWN,It might be 'cause you keep being so scary! 
10,25,160,FORSYTHIA,I really am sorry! Roserade's always scared quite easily and spends most of the time hiding out. 
10,25,161,DAWN,Roserade's always done that? 
10,25,162,FORSYTHIA,Long as I remember. Even back when Roserade was still a sweet little Budew. 
10,25,163,NURSE JOY,Welcome back! 
10,25,164,NURSE JOY,Would you come with me into the examination room? 
10,25,165,FORSYTHIA,Thanks! 
10,25,166,BUDEW,[SCARED] 
10,25,167,NURSE JOY,"I've been watching nonstop, tending to the injuries received when that wild Budew picked that awful fight. Thankfully, the physical wounds seem to have all healed up. "
10,25,168,NURSE JOY,But Budew's never really bonded with any of the other Pokémon here. 
10,25,169,NURSE JOY,"Budew, dear, isn't it time for you to go and have a snack with all of the other Pokémon? "
10,25,170,BUDEW,[QUESTIONING] 
10,25,171,BUDEW,[HAPPY] 
10,25,172,FORSYTHIA,Really? You like these? 
10,25,173,BUDEW,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,25,174,FORSYTHIA,"Hey, I know! If you'd like to see, I have lots and lots of flowers at my house! "
10,25,175,BUDEW,[EXCITED] 
10,25,176,FORSYTHIA,Would that be all right? 
10,25,177,NURSE JOY,"Yes, of course it would! "
10,25,178,NURSE JOY,Whatever makes Budew happy! 
10,25,179,FORSYTHIA,"Well then, we'll see you later! "
10,25,180,BUDEW,[CURIOUS] 
10,25,181,FORSYTHIA,"Yes, it is cold outside! "
10,25,182,BUDEW,[HAPPY] 
10,25,183,FORSYTHIA,Budew loved caring for the flowers! 
10,25,184,FORSYTHIA,"And before I knew it, Budew evolved into Roselia, and finally into my beautiful Roserade! "
10,25,185,FORSYTHIA,"Now, Roserade and I have become quite the team! "

10,24,65,THERESA,Aunt Abigail's to be in a bake off contest days from now! I just know your Pikachu would really help her! 
10,24,66,ASH,But won't she be able to tell the difference? 
10,24,67,THERESA,All your Pikachu has to do is simply scratch its head with its tail every once in a while! 
10,24,68,PIKACHU,[CURIOUS] 
10,24,69,THERESA,That's it! That's just what Sugar always does!

10,24,117,DAWN,The sweet taste of roasted berries is delicious! 
10,24,118,THERESA,Isn't it? And using Pikachu's Thunderbolt is the best method to get that unique flavor! 
10,24,119,BROCK,Who knew? I can't wait to go try out that technique for myself! 
10,24,120,ASH,"Wow, Pikachu's never done anything like this before... "
10,24,121,ASH,I think I'm gonna go have a look! 
10,24,122,ABIGAIL,"Well now, Sugar, this should be plenty! "

10,24,266,DAWN,But you know but we can't just leave Pikachuhere with her forever...

10,24,268,ASH,"Yeah, but in our battle I think that she quit early because of Pi I mean because of how much Sugar means to her. I'm starting to have a bad feeling about the bake off now. Really bad! "
10,24,269,THERESA,"But, Ash... "
10,24,270,ASH,"The thing is, I really wanted to help your Aunt get over being sad, but we're not telling the truth! I'm sorry but I've got to set the record straight once and for all! "

10,24,282,ABIGAIL,"This is actually your Pikachu, Ash... Is that right? "
10,24,283,THERESA,So you already knew?! 
10,24,284,ABIGAIL,"Yes, dear. Pikachu did a fine job on this, but Sugar never did it in exactly the same way! "

10,24,286,PIKACHU,[SURPRISED] 
10,24,287,ABIGAIL,To tell the truth we actually know why Sugar disappeared. 
10,24,288,THERESA,Aunt Abigail! 
10,24,289,ABIGAIL,Sugar and I were discussing this year's bake off and how I wanted to make a cake even more delicious than last year's. 
10,24,290,ABIGAIL,I said I wanted to use these Aspear Berries. 
10,24,291,ABIGAIL,But try as Sugar might you see Sugar's Thunderbolt couldn't cr*ck the berries open and I kept asking Sugar to please try and find a way! 
10,24,292,THERESA,Then Sugar left to go find some way to do what my aunt had asked. 
10,24,293,ABIGAIL,You've all been very kind to me and I'm more grateful than words can ever express! 
10,24,294,ABIGAIL,"Now, I feel much better having spent this wonderful dayalong with your Pikachu! "

10,24,316,JAMES,What a bunch of schlubs! 
10,24,317,MEOWTH,Yeah! They've got no idea this babe is hard as an Aspear Berry! 
10,24,318,MEOWTH,And of course the name Aspear Rock might be a giveaway. 
10,24,319,DAWN,That thing's strong! 
10,24,320,BROCK,Staravia's Wing att*ck is having no effect at all! 
10,24,321,STARAVIA,[WING att*ck MOVE]

10,24,324,JESSIE,There should be a law against stubborn twerps! 
10,24,325,JAMES,But there's no law against giving a twerp the brush off right? 
10,24,326,MEOWTH,Not in my book! 
10,24,327,JESSIE,"All right, Jack. "

10,24,352,JESSIE,Who turned on the lights? 
10,24,353,ASH,Looks like a Thunderbolt! 
10,24,354,DAWN,But it can't be Pikachu it's coming from the outside!

10,24,364,THERESA,Sugar evolved into Raichu? 
10,24,365,JESSIE,No wonder that Thunderbolt thundered and thumped! 
10,24,366,JAMES,I say we rethink this let's cast a wider net! 
10,24,367,MEOWTH,You bet! Raichu's who I'm gonna get!

10,24,403,BROCK,Or maybe two! 
10,24,404,ASH,Wow. That's good!

10,24,406,BROCK,There's something about the tartness of the AspearBerries that just hits the spot!

10,24,408,ABIGAIL,You're all very kind.

10,23,20,"JESSIE, JAMES",Right! 
10,23,21,JAMES,Perhaps we've dug through to the other side. 
10,23,22,JESSIE,They must want my shovel. If that's truethey - won't let go! - 
10,23,23,JAMES,I'm stuck as well! 
10,23,24,MEOWTH,Yeah it's likeglue!

10,23,32,JESSIE,You can have the dumb shovels! 
10,23,33,STEELIX,[GROWL] -

10,23,37,MEOWTH,Our shovels got stuck in Steelix's stony head! 
10,23,38,JESSIE,"Well, that certainly makes more sense than what we initially thought. "
10,23,39,JAMES,It stands to reason that our shovels would be wedged! Steelix has quite the hard - as - nails physique. 
10,23,40,"MEOWTH, ",Save the chit - chat for later!

10,23,61,ASH,"Yeah, you're right! "
10,23,62,POKEDEX,"Bidoof. The Plump Mouse Pokémon. It gnaws on trees and rocks with its strong front teeth, and lives in nests near the water. "
10,23,63,DAWN,But is there water around here? 
10,23,64,BROCK,"Well, if there's any water in the forest we surehaven't seen it. "
10,23,65,ASH,I'll bet you this Bidoof got lost! 
10,23,66,PIKACHU,[QUESTIONING] 
10,23,67,DAWN,"Aww, I'm sure Bidoof misses all of its friends. "
10,23,68,BROCK,It says there's a waterfall just up ahead! - 
10,23,69,ASH,Yeah? - 
10,23,70,DAWN,That's great! It sounds like the ideal spot forBidoof to live! 
10,23,71,BROCK,So let's bring this Bidoof back there! - 
10,23,72,ASH,Yeah! - 
10,23,73,DAWN,Let's go!

10,23,90,POKEDEX,"Steelix. The Iron Snake Pokémon. Strengthened by the pressure and intense heat of living underground, its body is stronger than steel. "
10,23,91,STEELIX,[GROWL] 
10,23,92,ASH,That Steelix doesn't look very happy. 
10,23,93,PIKACHU,[SURPRISED] 
10,23,94,DAWN,Steelix's head has three shovels stuck in it! 
10,23,95,BROCK,Did you three have anything to do with this? 
10,23,96,JESSIE,"Excuse me, but we're the victims, not Steelix! "
10,23,97,JAMES,We were spending a lovely afternoon digging a few innocent pit traps! 
10,23,98,MEOWTH,But instead of digging dirt we ended up diggingSteelix's bean! 
10,23,99,STEELIX,[ROAR] 
10,23,100,"ASH, DAWN, BROCK",That would make us angry too! 
10,23,101,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",The twerps' point is well taken!

10,23,105,BROCK,A fork in the road! 
10,23,106,DAWN,But which way should we go? 
10,23,107,ASH,I think Bidoof said left! 
10,23,108,JAMES,The twerps must know something we don't know! 
10,23,109,JESSIE,Going where they go is close enough! 
10,23,110,STEELIX,[HYPER BEAM MOVE] 
10,23,111,MEOWTH,"Okay, you got shovels in your head but was that Hyper Beam necessary? "
10,23,112,STEELIX,[ROAR] - 
10,23,113,DAWN,"Uh oh, here it comes! - "
10,23,114,ASH,Then let's go! 
10,23,115,STEELIX,[ROAR] 
10,23,116,JAMES,My head! 
10,23,117,JESSIE,From now on we carry aspirin! 
10,23,118,JAMES,But it looks like we've been abandoned in favor of the twerps! 
10,23,119,JESSIE,Team Rocket really does have a lucky streak! 
10,23,120,JESSIE,Hold on 
10,23,121,JAMES,We're short by one Meowth! 
10,23,122,JESSIE,Our streak is smudging! 
10,23,123,JAMES,Are you perhaps thinking what I'm thinking? 
10,23,124,"JESSIE, JAMES",Meowth's being stalked by Steelix! 
10,23,125,STEELIX,[GROWL] 
10,23,126,MEOWTH,Doesn't that lug ever take a break?

10,23,131,BROCK,"Look, an opening! "
10,23,132,ASH,"Quick, let's duck in there! "
10,23,133,STEELIX,[GROWL] 
10,23,134,BROCK,Look at that! The rock around here must be too hard for even Steelix to punch through! 
10,23,135,ASH,I guess that means we're safe - at least for now! 
10,23,136,DAWN,I hope that rock holds out! 
10,23,137,DAWN,Hey guys. Look over there! 
10,23,138,ASH,Wow! I think it's a Bidoof Village!

10,23,145,ASH,It's great! 
10,23,146,BROCK,"But I wonder, why didn't anyone come looking for that Bidoof? "
10,23,147,BIDOOF A,[SHEEPISH] 
10,23,148,MEOWTH,"See, that Steelix scared the teeth off of them! - They were hiding out! - "
10,23,149,DAWN,The poor things. 
10,23,150,BIDOOF MAYOR,[CONCERNED] 
10,23,151,MEOWTH,"It's true the rock around here is hard, but that Bidoof says it can't keep Steelix out forever! "
10,23,152,MEOWTH,Sooner or later that opening is going to give out! 
10,23,153,MEOWTH,That dude needs mood music!
10,23,154,S TEELIX,[ROAR] 
10,23,155,ASH,The opening!

10,23,180,DAWN,And their village is in grave danger! 
10,23,181,BROCK,And it's all because of what you did to Steelix! 
10,23,182,BIDOOF GROUP,[UPSET] 
10,23,183,JESSIE,Oh come on! Cut us a break! One step out of here and we'll be Steelix stew! 
10,23,184,JESSIE,Right! Stop thinking of yourself for a sec!

10,23,239,BROCK,It just might work! 
10,23,240,ASH,"Okay, but how do we get that close? "
10,23,241,DAWN,There! If we can get Steelix into the gully we'll get at the shovels from above! -

10,22,247,ASH,"Yeah, that's it! "
10,22,248,PACHIRISU,[MOAN] 
10,22,249,VILLAGE HEAD,Pachirisu's unable to battle! 
10,22,250,NURSE JOY,And even with plenty of time left on the clock to spare Jessie is our Contest winner! 
10,22,251,DAWN,"Hey, don't worry Pachirisu... "
10,22,252,PACHIRISU,[SAD] 
10,22,253,DAWN,That was great practice for the Contestin Floaroma Town! And that's what counts!

10,22,283,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",So let's eat! 
10,22,284,JAMES,And look! They're too scared to chase us! 
10,22,285,ASH,I guess those guys don't remember that they didn't steal anything this time. 
10,22,286,BROCK,"As you remember, old habits die hard. "
10,22,287,DAWN,They're so weird. 
10,22,288,AIPOM,[SAD] 
10,22,289,AIPOM,[WORRIED] 
10,22,290,ASH,"Hey, Aipom, where you going? "
10,22,291,JESSIE,Apey dear! 
10,22,292,AIPOM,[EXCITED] 
10,22,293,JESSIE,Could it be? I think my little Apey wants to be under new ownership! 
10,22,294,ASH,"So, that's it. I guess you wanna be with them more than you want to be with me. "
10,22,295,PIKACHU,[POINTING OUT] 
10,22,296,DAWN,Better look again. 
10,22,297,BROCK,Aipom appears to be in love with all of Team Rocket's fruit!

10,22,299,MEOWTH,"It's cool to have a taste, but you don't have to be a Munchlax about it! "
10,22,300,JAMES,It wasn't bananas over you; it was over the fruit! 
10,22,301,ASH,"Hey, Aipom, come back! "
10,22,302,ASH,You'd better get back here now!

10,22,319,AIPOM,[SWIFT MOVE] 
10,22,320,JAMES,We almost didn't have to worry about food for a whole year! 
10,22,321,JESSIE,"When I win that Contest Ribbon, we'll never worry about food again! "
10,22,322,MEOWTH,But eating ribbons always gives me gas! 
10,22,323,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",We're blasting off again! 
10,22,324,ASH,"You sure caused us a lot of trouble, Aipom. You really ought to cool it! "
10,22,325,BROCK,"Come on. All's well that ends well. Right, Ash? "
10,22,326,DAWN,I have this funny feeling Aipom likes Contests more than - Gym battles! - 
10,22,327,ASH,"Nah! Aipom loves battling in the Gyms! Go ahead and tell them, Aipom! "
10,22,328,AIPOM,[HAPPY EXCITEMENT] 
10,22,329,NARRATOR,"Although the village festival Pokémon Contest ended in defeat for Dawn, she learned a great deal about how important good training is for any Pokémon, but she also saw yet another example of just what a great Trainer Ash is as well! Not to mention, our hero is the perfect subject for Aipom's pranks. TO BE CONTINUED.."
10,21,0,JAMES,Presenting our power-packed Poké-Evolution Machine One!

"
10,21,5,JESSIE,Enough already. 
10,21,6,MEOWTH,Sinnoh's been a big fat bust. 
10,21,7,JAMES,"Oh, for a bit of delightful diversion. "
10,21,8,MAGIKARP,[GROANS] 
10,21,9,MAGIKARP SALESMAN,You can't find a finer Magikarp. Now isn't that amazing? 
10,21,10,MAGIKARP SALESMAN,"Order now and I'll throw in three special gifts: this handsome small bowl set, this smaller bowl set, and this porcelain light fixture and eggcup! "
10,21,11,JAMES,"You're none other than that malevolent Magikarp salesman, and we won't be fooled again! "
10,21,12,MAGIKARP SALESMAN,Of course not! Want a Feebas? 
10,21,13,JESSIE,What we want is our money back! 
10,21,14,JAMES,We're into you for a small fortune! 
10,21,15,MEOWTH,Or more! 
10,21,16,MAGIKARP SALESMAN,Say! I know you! I just love dealing with repeat customers! And are you in luck! 
10,21,17,MAGIKARP SALESMAN,How would you like to get in on the ground - floor of the next big thing? - 
10,21,18,JAMES,What might that be? 
10,21,19,MAGIKARP SALESMAN,Take a look! 
10,21,20,MEOWTH,Cardboard? 
10,21,21,MAGIKARP SALESMAN,It's what's inside this cardboard: The Poké-Evolution Machine One! 
10,21,22,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",A Pokémon Evolution Machine? 
10,21,23,JAMES,Are you pulling our proverbial legs? 
10,21,24,MAGIKARP SALESMAN,No peeking! This is the result of years of top-secretwork! Do you realize the power of having a billion-dollar corporation backing you up? Hundreds of famous Pokémon scientists have been doing ground-breaking research and this is the end result! The cutting-est of cutting edge technology now brings you the contents of this cardboard case! 
10,21,25,SCIENTIST,The wave of the evolutionary future! 
10,21,26,MAGIKARP SALESMAN,"Yes, the Poké-Evolution Machine One was completed, but alas. The company was forced into bankruptcy. "
10,21,27,MAGIKARP SALESMAN,"But I gave the workers the rights to build these miracle machines, and they in turn gave me everything I needed to build one for myself. "
10,21,28,MAGIKARP SALESMAN,And that's just what we have in here! 
10,21,29,MAGIKARP SALESMAN,"The gift from a grateful workforce to me, their savior. Of course it comes with the case, candy, and what they call in the evolution business, the brain of the miracle machine! "
10,21,30,JESSIE,But how easy can it be to make one of those things? 
10,21,31,MAGIKARP SALESMAN,"If you can read simple directions and do everything they tell you to, even an Aipom can build it! Think people, think! With this baby, you can cause any Pokémon to evolve wherever you want and whenever you want, guaranteed, or your money back! - "
10,21,32,JESSIE,My money back? - 
10,21,33,"JAMES, MEOWTH",That's honesty! 
10,21,34,MAGIKARP SALESMAN,"What would you expect to pay for the instruction manual and brain, handsomely bound with this rubber band?! More than you think! "
10,21,35,JAMES,Wow! This is like one of those science kits I had as a child! 
10,21,36,MAGIKARP SALESMAN,"And, after our previous transaction, - I'll sell it to you wholesale! - "
10,21,37,JAMES,I'll take it! 
10,21,38,MAGIKARP SALESMAN,And sold! 
10,21,39,JAMES,A pleasure doing business! 
10,21,40,MAGIKARP SALESMAN,"You don't know the half of it! Uh oh, I forgot! There's one tiny little detail! Don't use the machine until a week after you've built it! "
10,21,41,MEOWTH,A whole week? 
10,21,42,MAGIKARP SALESMAN,Machines like that need time to warm up! - 
10,21,43,JAMES,Right! - 
10,21,44,MAGIKARP SALESMAN,Right! 
10,21,45,MAGIKARP SALESMAN,Yahoo! 
10,21,46,JAMES,We've got our diversion! 
10,21,47,MEOWTH,And a way to make a big fat buck! 
10,21,48,JESSIE,What luck! 
10,21,49,NARRATOR,"As our heroes continue to make their waytoward the Eterna City Gym, the Gym's location has brought them - back through Jubilife City. - "
10,21,50,INTERVIEWER,Excuse me! We're from Jubilife's Sinnoh Today show and want to know if you used anything mechanical to evolve - that Pikachu of yours. - 
10,21,51,ASH,I wouldn't do that. 
10,21,52,INTERVIEWER,"So, then you must be from the B-Button League right? "
10,21,53,DAWN,What's the B-Button League anyway? 
10,21,54,INTERVIEWER,You've never heard of the league? It's a group of Coordinators in Jubilife City that compete for the Top Coordinator spot without evolving their Pokémon! 
10,21,55,"ASH, DAWN, BROCK",Without evolving? 
10,21,56,INTERVIEWER,You really haven't heard of them! Their leaders are well known for having the strongest Magikarp - and the loveliest Feebas! - 
10,21,57,DAWN,Wow! 
10,21,58,ASH,"The strongest Magikarp, huh? Sounds awesome! "
10,21,59,BROCK,I'd love to see. 
10,21,60,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
10,21,61,ASH,Do you think you could tell us where we can find the Button League? This's it! Anyone here? - 
10,21,62,ORALIE,Hi! - 
10,21,63,HALEY,And welcome! 
10,21,64,DAWN,So is this the B-Button League headquarters? 
10,21,65,ORALIE,It sure is. Would you like to join? 
10,21,66,BROCK,Oh yeah! 
10,21,67,ASH,"Actually, first we'd like to see what you guys do here! "
10,21,68,HALEY,"No problem. My name's Haley, and I'm the B-Button League leader! "
10,21,69,ORALIE,"I'm her sister, Oralie! - "
10,21,70,ASH,I'm Ash! - 
10,21,71,DAWN,I'm Dawn! 
10,21,72,BROCK,"And I'm Brock! I know what the B stands for! With your looks, sweetheart, and yours, the only B word I can think of that's worthy of you two is beauty! "
10,21,73,BROCK,Just imagine spending every day together hand-in-hand and working tirelessly for the B-Button League and standing tall. Or standing small! 
10,21,74,CROAGUNK,[LAUGHING] 
10,21,75,ASH,I heard the B-Button League had the strongest Magikarp! 
10,21,76,DAWN,"And the loveliest Feebas, too! "
10,21,77,HALEY,Have a look! 
10,21,78,"BROCK, ASH, DAWN, PIKACHU",[EXCITED] 
10,21,79,ORALIE,This is my Magikarp... 
10,21,80,FEEBAS,[BOASTING] 
10,21,81,HALEY,...and this is my Feebas! 
10,21,82,ASH,Wow! They weren't kidding! 
10,21,83,DAWN,Those two are awesome! 
10,21,84,POKEDEX,"Magikarp. The Fish Pokémon. Magikarp can live inthe dirtiest of water. It jumps very well, and can evolve into Gyarados. "
10,21,85,POKEDEX,"Feebas. The Fish Pokémon. Although extremely ragged, it is a tough Pokémon that can live in almost any kind of water. Its evolved form is Milotic. "
10,21,86,HALEY,The B-Button League believes there's more to a Pokémon than just evolving. 
10,21,87,BROCK,"I completely agree with that, one hundred percent! "
10,21,88,ORALIE,"So, without evolving them, members of the B-Button League concentrate on strengthening their Pokémon. "
10,21,89,HALEY,And beautifying them! 
10,21,90,DAWN,I think it's kind of a neat idea! 
10,21,91,BROCK,"Of course, when a Pokémon evolves, it naturally becomes stronger and learns new moves. "
10,21,92,ORALIE,The thing is.I love Magikarp! 
10,21,93,HALEY,And I love my Feebas! 
10,21,94,ORALIE,I don't want my Magikarp to change! 
10,21,95,HALEY,We want to teach our Pokémon beautiful new moves without evolving! 
10,21,96,ASH,"Yeah, I want Pikachu to get stronger and not change! "
10,21,97,HALEY,"Well if that's the case, the B-Button League was made for you! "
10,21,98,BROCK,guess evolution does have its good and bad points. The world of Pokémon is pretty complex! 
10,21,99,DAWN,Sure is. eird. It looks like a normal Magikarp to me. 
10,21,100,ASH,"You can't judge a Pokémon by its cover! Hey, it'd be awesome if you'd have a battle with me and my Pikachu! I'd really like to check out your Magikarp. - "
10,21,101,ORALIE,Of course! - 
10,21,102,DAWN,"Hey, hold on! "
10,21,103,DAWN,"I'd love it if you'd go and give Piplup a sh*t! Yeah, you see I've wanted to check out how Piplup battles in the water for such a long time! "
10,21,104,ASH,"Hey, I'd like to see Piplup in water too, but against that Magikarp? I'm not sure. "
10,21,105,DAWN,"Well, I'm sure, and that's that! Now, Piplup, let's go! "
10,21,106,PIPLUP,[APPEARING]

10,21,112,JESSIE,We decided to take the B-Button League a Sinnoh step further and organize the C-Button League! 
10,21,113,HALEY,How nice. 
10,21,114,JESSIE,Aren't we? Not only nice but perceptive! Like knowing the B in your name stands for victory. 
10,21,115,JAMES,Have you forgotten victory is spelled with a V? 
10,21,116,JESSIE,"So it does! Perhaps, the B stands for Bulbasaur, or blackmail, or big blabbermouth. - "
10,21,117,JAMES,Or beautiful? - 
10,21,118,JESSIE,Bingo! So you're the leaders of the Beautiful Button League right? 
10,21,119,ORALIE,"Why, yes. That's right! "
10,21,120,HALEY,"So, what does the C in C-Button stand for? "
10,21,121,JESSIE,"Uh... I hate being put on the spot! Seaside Slackers! No, She-Sells-Seashells-by-the-Sea- by-the-Sea-by-the-Seashore League! "

10,21,123,ORALIE,Wow! 
10,21,124,JESSIE,"We'd really like to do an expose on you B-Buttoners. So if you wouldn't mind, we're here to dig deep and do a little research! "
10,21,125,MEOWTH,I'd like to take some pics. Is that cool? 
10,21,126,ORALIE,Of course! We were just about to begin a battle between Dawn's Piplup and the world's most powerful Magikarp! 
10,21,127,JAMES,Say! Sounds like a party to me! 
10,21,128,DAWN,"Okay, Piplup, go! "
10,21,129,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
10,21,130,ORALIE,"Now, Magikarp, are you ready? "
10,21,131,ASH,"Do it, Dawn! Good luck! "
10,21,132,JESSIE,We'll sit tight and bide our time. 
10,21,133,JAMES,Then we pluck Pikachu and give our Pokémon Evolution Machine a spin! 
10,21,134,MEOWTH,That yellow yahoo won't know what hit it! 
10,21,135,DAWN,"Now Piplup, let's start it out with Peck! "

10,21,185,JESSIE,Wow! Think of the giga-Gyarados this Magikarp would be! 
10,21,186,JESSIE,"That baby would strike sheer fear, far and near! "
10,21,187,JESSIE,What do you think of whipping out our Poké-Evolution Machine One and using it on Magikarp for a test run? 
10,21,188,JAMES,Sounds like fun! 
10,21,189,MEOWTH,"Drive it around the block before we blast Pikachu! Yeah, kick the tires. "

10,20,128,DAWN,What's a Pokémon Hunter? 
10,20,129,JENNY,The worst you can get! 
10,20,130,JENNY,They catch Pokémon just so they can - turn around and sell them! - 
10,20,131,DAWN,You mean for money? 
10,20,132,JENNY,"Yes! They can be hired ahead of time to capture a certain Pokémon, or if they think they've found a Pokémon of exceptional value, they'll catch it anyway. "
10,20,133,J,I won't hurt you. You're much too valuable for that! 
10,20,134,JENNY,And she has her own special method for stealing Pokémon as well! Ruthless! 
10,20,135,BROCK,That's horrible! 
10,20,136,DAWN,It sure is! She's the worst! 
10,20,137,DAWN,What's wrong? You okay? 
10,20,138,ASH,I can't stand it! And I'm not going to take it! 
10,20,139,ASH,"She won't steal another Pokémon! And I'm going to get my Pikachu back, or else! "
10,20,140,JAMES,Pokémon Hunters sound like the lowest of the low.

10,20,142,JAMES,Excuse me? 
10,20,143,JESSIE,"I know I'm much prettier than her, but I will not be out-nastied by a Team Rocket wannabe, see? "
10,20,144,MEOWTH,I feel like I've been at the beach. I forgot I'm not stuck in sand; I'm stuck in cement! 
10,20,145,SUBORDINATE ,It's time to add you to our catalog. Now say cheese! 
10,20,146,MEOWTH,"Let's see, what kind of cheese? Something stinky like him. No such thing! "
10,20,147,MEOWTH,Why are you putting my mug in your magazine? 
10,20,148,SUBORDINATE ,A talking Meowth is worth at least its weight in gold! 
10,20,149,MEOWTH,Is that all? I want a cut! 
10,20,150,SUBORDINATE ,I'm not sure your big mouth is worth the trouble. Out you go!

10,20,152,SUBORDINATE ,You've got it. 
10,20,153,MEOWTH,Got to get my paws on that switch. 
10,20,154,MEOWTH,"Man, Piakchu's looking pretty messed up inside of that shell, but what can I do about it? "
10,20,155,ASH,"So, Jenny, any clues as to where J went? "
10,20,156,JENNY,"Not so far. J's identity is a mystery! All we know is that after she steals Pokémon, then she makes her escape in that huge machine you saw before. "
10,20,157,DAWN,No way we can chase that. 
10,20,158,ASH,"Brock, what do you think? "
10,20,159,BROCK,"The thing is. we can't chase after her, but if we could predict the next place she'll show up. "
10,20,160,MELODI,Excuse me. Maybe this Pokémon could give us a hand. 
10,20,161,KIRLIA,[APPEARING] 
10,20,162,DAWN,Wow what's that? 
10,20,163,POKEDEX,"Kirlia. The Emotion Pokémon. Kirlia uses the horns on its head to amplify its Psychic powers, and when this occurs reality becomes warped and future events can be seen. "
10,20,164,BROCK,Of course! Kirlia's power might be just the thing we need! 
10,20,165,MELODI,"You're right. Kirlia wants to protect Gardevoir, and will help us in any way! "
10,20,166,MELODI,This is the person who took Gardevoir. We need to know where she'll be going to hunt Pokémon next! 
10,20,167,KIRLIA,[CONCENTRATING] 
10,20,168,DAWN,What's that? 
10,20,169,MELODI,An image from the future Kirlia's sending telepathically. 
10,20,170,ASH,J! 
10,20,171,BROCK,So that's got to be where J's going to strike next! 
10,20,172,MELODI,"Kirlia, no! Are you okay? "
10,20,173,ASH,But wait! Do you know where that is? 
10,20,174,JENNY,No doubt! There's a small hut and waterwheel right at the forest's edge! 
10,20,175,ASH,So let's get over there right now! 
10,20,176,JENNY,With pleasure! Then she'll get what she deserves! This is Jenny. I have determined the Pokémon Hunter's next strike point. I'll need to get that area completely surrounded! 
10,20,177,ASH,"Hang in there, Pikachu! I'm getting you out of there right away! "
10,20,178,JENNY,The forest ends just ahead! 
10,20,179,JENNY,"No, we still haven't got them surrounded yet! "
10,20,180,JENNY,Ash wait! It's too dangerous! 
10,20,181,ASH,J! Gimme back Pikachu now!

10,20,198,JENNY,Where did Ash go? 
10,20,199,BROCK,Probably hanging on for dear life! 
10,20,200,ASH,We'd better split up and have a look.

10,20,207,J,What are you talking about? 
10,20,208,MEOWTH,"Dig! I'm a Poké-translator! I can tell you what they're thinking, and that'd give you a leg up in your line of work! - "
10,20,209,J,"What they're thinking, eh? - "
10,20,210,MEOWTH,Oh yeah. 
10,20,211,MEOWTH,Those Pokémon'll be running up and jumping in these glass jugs!

10,19,214,JAMES,But when Jessie threw her Poké Ball it had no issues climbing inside. 
10,19,215,MEOWTH,"And of course, if there was another landlord it wouldn't have done that! "
10,19,216,JESSIE,"Touché! So, if you're promoting this as your property let's see you call it back to your Poké Ball! "
10,19,217,JESSIE,"I thought so. Perhaps Pachirisu is purely taking a walk on the wild side as a free, unsigned agent! "
10,19,218,DAWN,All right! It's true I let it go but I'm catching it again! 
10,19,219,JESSIE,"Well well well, that may be on your Twerpish wish list, but I think Pachirisu has other plans! "
10,19,220,DAWN,You think so?

10,19,292,JESSIE,So! Better luck next time! Bye! 
10,19,293,JAMES,But what about Pikachu? 
10,19,294,JESSIE,Each time we help ourselves to too much we get our heads handed to us so for today one is more than enough! 
10,19,295,MEOWTH,What do you know! I think that moosh knocked a little sense into our resident queenie! 
10,19,296,JAMES,Of course it's just a GUESS! 
10,19,297,DAWN,Pachirisu! 
10,19,298,JESSIE,And what's a queen without an adorable subject? Sweetie. Love of my life. Baby doll! 
10,19,299,PACHIRISU,[HAPPY] 
10,19,300,JESSIE,If I want that brand of affection I'll just b*at my head against the wall. 
10,19,301,JAMES,"The thing is, I actually thought Jessie was getting smarter. "
10,19,302,MEOWTH,All things must pass. 
10,19,303,JESSIE,We're blasting off again! 
10,19,304,WOBBUFFET,[AGREEING] 
10,19,305,DAWN,Oh well...I guess Pachirisu didn't really like me after all although I can't blame Pachirisu for a moment after I did the awfully silly things I did. 
10,19,306,ASH,I wouldn't be so sure. 
10,19,307,ASH,"Yeah, just have a look! "
10,19,308,PACHIRISU,[HAPPY] 
10,19,309,DAWN,You came back! 
10,19,310,PACHIRISU,[AFFECTIONATE] 
10,19,311,BROCK,"Well, you can't say Pachirisu doesn't like you, Dawn! "
10,19,312,ASH,"Yeah, check it out! "
10,19,313,DAWN,It's so great you're back! 
10,19,314,PACHIRISU,[HAPPY] 
10,19,315,DAWN,Oh no not again! 
10,19,316,DAWN,Who cares? 
10,19,317,PACHIRISU,[HAPPY] 
10,19,318,DAWN,"Pachirisu, how'd you like to come with us? "
10,19,319,PACHIRISU,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,19,320,DAWN,Wow! This Pachirisu is mine! 
10,19,321,ASH,You got a new friend! 
10,19,322,BROCK,"Yeah, and we've just added some serious speed andcuteness to our family! "
10,19,323,NARRATOR,"There's nothing like the thrill of catching a new Pokémon for inspiration. And in the case of Pachirisu, you can be certain that Dawn's more resolved than ever to make her next Pokémon Contest a winning one! TO BE CONTINUED.."
10,18,0,NARRATOR,"Ash and his Pokémon were smack-dab in the middle of an intensive special training regimen in preparation for his rematch with Roark, the Oreburgh Gym leader, when suddenly, the restored Ancient Pokémon Aerodactyl mounted a frenzied as*ault on Oreburgh City, sending its citizens into a panic! But Dawn and her Buneary and Piplup sprang into action and were able to quell the mayhem, while providing Ash with some valuable clues on formulating the battle strategy he was seeking. Now, knowing he was sure to face Roark's newly evolved Rampardos in his upcoming battle, will Ash emerge victorious and capture his first Sinnoh region badge? [singing] POKEMON, POKEMON IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CHALLENGES IT'S A BRAND-NEW GAME AND A BRAND-NEW WORLD NEW RIVALS AS YOU FIGHT FOR SURVIVAL NOTHING CAN STOP YOU - DIAMOND AND PEARL - POKEMON IT'S ALL ABOUT THE BATTLE YOU GOTTA PLAY SMART, YOU GOTTA MOVE FASTER BEHIND EVERY WIN,THERE'S A CHANCE TO BEGIN AGAIN YOU GOTTA TAKE IT ALL IF YOU WANT TO BE A MASTER POKEMON, POKEMON - IT'S TIME FOR ADVENTURE - DIAMOND AND PEARL - WE CAN CHANGE THE WORLD - POKEMON O'er The Rampardos We Watched!

10,18,1,ROARK,"Well, well! I'd say that spring in your step betrays some newfound confidence! Of course, after all that hard training you have every right to it. Good for you! "
10,18,2,ASH,Thanks! And today I'm leaving here with that badge for sure! 
10,18,3,IAN,The Gym battle between Ash from Pallet Town and Roark the Oreburgh Gym leader will now begin! 
10,18,4,IAN,"Each side will have the use of three Pokémon and the battle will be over when all of either side's Pokémon are unable to battle! In addition, only the challenger is allowed to make any substitutions! - "
10,18,5,BROCK,"Excuse me, Dawn. - "
10,18,6,DAWN,"What, Brock? "
10,18,7,BROCK,I hope you don't mind if I ask... 
10,18,8,BROCK,.but why are you dressed up like that? 
10,18,9,DAWN,Oh this? It's because of all the special training I did with Ash! I just have to cheer him on all the way! 
10,18,10,DAWN,So! You two ready to give it all you've got? 
10,18,11,DAWN,"Go Ash, number one! Battle hard and get it done! Time to get this battle won! Do it right and have some fun! "
10,18,12,ASH,"Hey thanks, Dawn! After all of that how could I not win this battle? "
10,18,13,ROARK,"Onix, let's go! "
10,18,14,ONIX,[APPEARING] 
10,18,15,ASH,"So Onix is up first, huh? Ready to go, Pikachu? "
10,18,16,PIKACHU,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,18,17,PIKACHU,[DETERMINED] 
10,18,18,IAN,Then let the battle begin! 
10,18,19,ASH,"Pikachu! Quick att*ck, now! "
10,18,20,ROARK,"Come on! Normal-type att*cks aren't going to cause much damage at all! Onix, let's show them, so use Slam! "
10,18,21,ASH,I'm not using it to cause damage. 
10,18,22,ONIX,[ROAR] 
10,18,23,ASH,Pikachu dodge and climb on to Onix now! 
10,18,24,PIKACHU,[EXERTION] 
10,18,25,ROARK,"Excellent! He used Quick att*ck to build up speed which helped Pikachu to climb onto Onix! Onix! Use Screech, let's go! "
10,18,26,ONIX,[SCREECH MOVE] 
10,18,27,PIKACHU,[STRUGGLING] - 
10,18,28,ASH,Hold on tight! - 
10,18,29,ROARK,Onix! Shake it off! 
10,18,30,ONIX,[ROAR] 
10,18,31,DAWN,What's Pikachu going to do? 
10,18,32,PIKACHU,[EXERTION] 
10,18,33,ASH,You can do it Pikachu! Use Iron Tail and give it your best sh*t! 
10,18,34,PIKACHU,[IRON TAIL MOVE] 
10,18,35,ONIX,[PAINED] - 
10,18,36,DAWN,Right on target! - 
10,18,37,BROCK,And a strong hit too! 
10,18,38,ASH,"Way to go! Great, Pikachu! "
10,18,39,ROARK,Pikachu's speed and power are much sharper than last time! It looks like your special training has paid off! 
10,18,40,ROARK,"See how you like this! Quick Onix, Double Edge! "
10,18,41,ONIX,[DOUBLE-EDGE MOVE] - 
10,18,42,DAWN,Whoa! - 
10,18,43,ASH,"Let's go, Pikachu! "
10,18,44,PIKACHU,[DETERMINED] 
10,18,45,ONIX,[ROAR] 
10,18,46,SUDOWOODO,[SURPRISED] 
10,18,47,ASH,Now spin! 
10,18,48,PIKACHU,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,18,49,ASH,"Wow, that really worked great! "
10,18,50,BROCK,"Whoa, what a dodge! "
10,18,51,DAWN,There's nothing like when a new move works! 
10,18,52,ROARK,Brilliant! Pikachu's spinning creates a lot of wind pressure and that acts just like a dodging cushion! 
10,18,53,ROARK,And the stronger and faster we are. the more effective their move is! 
10,18,54,ASH,"Now, let's finish it with Iron Tail! "
10,18,55,PIKACHU,[IRON TAIL MOVE] 
10,18,56,ROARK,Dodge it! 
10,18,57,PIKACHU,[EXERTION] 
10,18,58,ROARK,"Quick, Onix, use Slam! "
10,18,59,ONIX,[SLAM MOVE] 
10,18,60,PIKACHU,[SCARED] 
10,18,61,ASH,Pikachu no! 
10,18,62,PIKACHU,[PAINED] 
10,18,63,DAWN,But how does Onix move so fast? 
10,18,64,BROCK,I don't know but Onix is a lot faster than last time! 
10,18,65,ROARK,"Ash, in between battles I don't just sit around and read comic books. "
10,18,66,ROARK,I've been training with Onix just as hard as ever! 
10,18,67,ROARK,You may have dodged Double Edge but there's a lot more to deal with than that in this Gym! 
10,18,68,ROARK,Onix! Use Stealth Rock! 
10,18,69,DAWN,Why would he use Stealth Rock now? 
10,18,70,BROCK,Remember Stealth Rock is a move that causes damage to each new Pokémon that comes out as a sub. 
10,18,71,BROCK,"By using it right now, Roark is really ratcheting up the pressure on Ash! "
10,18,72,ONIX,[STEALTH ROCK MOVE] 
10,18,73,ASH,"Now Pikachu, use Thunderbolt! "
10,18,74,ROARK,[SHOCKED] 
10,18,75,ONIX,[PAINED] 
10,18,76,ROARK,Oh no! 
10,18,77,ONIX,[ROAR] 
10,18,78,ASH,"Pikachu, finish this up with Iron Tail! "
10,18,79,ROARK,"Now. Screech, Onix! "
10,18,80,ONIX,[SCREECH MOVE] 
10,18,81,"PIKACHU, ONIX",[EXERTION] 
10,18,82,ROARK,Onix! 
10,18,83,PIKACHU,[DETERMINED] 
10,18,84,ONIX,[DAZED] 
10,18,85,IAN,Onix can't battle! Pikachu wins! 
10,18,86,ASH,"All right! Pikachu, way to go! "
10,18,87,DAWN,Awesome! Pikachu came through in a big way! 
10,18,88,BROCK,That pressure just might've put them over the top! 
10,18,89,BUNEARY,[AMAZED] 
10,18,90,ROARK,"You were great, Onix. Thanks. Now you take a nice long rest. That was quite an impressive move you just made! It blew back all that debris and pulverized Onix's Stealth Rock at the same time! And I don't need to tell you how difficult it is to cause Onix any damage at all! "
10,18,91,ASH,Thanks for the nice words! 
10,18,92,ROARK,"But that's behind us now! Geodude, let's go! "
10,18,93,GEODUDE,[APPEARING] 
10,18,94,ASH,"That Geodude's sure something! Pikachu, you take a break! "
10,18,95,PIKACHU,[RELIEVED] 
10,18,96,DAWN,"What? Why, just when those two have gotten the momentum? "
10,18,97,BROCK,Pikachu used up more strength and energy battling Onix than you can see. Ash made a smart choice! 
10,18,98,DAWN,I get it. 
10,18,99,ASH,"All right. Aipom, I choose you! "
10,18,100,AIPOM,[APPEARING]

10,18,104,JESSIE,Listen! Is that a quiet voice I hear? 
10,18,105,JAMES,It may not be loud but it sure is clear! 
10,18,106,MEOWTH,And the time for poaching Pokémon is near! - 
10,18,107,JESSIE,Jessie! -

10,18,118,MEOWTH,My built-in lock picker works every time no matter how dumb your jokes are! 
10,18,119,JAMES,Now! In we go. 
10,18,120,JESSIE,Anybody home? 
10,18,121,JESSIE,"Ah, the warm glow of an empty hall. "
10,18,122,MEOWTH,"While they're having a battle, we're having a ball! "
10,18,123,JESSIE,The longer those Twerps toil on that Gym b*ttlefield the better for our stealing skills! 
10,18,124,JAMES,Pikachu will be too pooped to prevent us from some serious Poké-pilfering! 
10,18,125,MEOWTH,Yeah! And don't forget a Gym's like a Pokémon candy store just ripe for robbing! 
10,18,126,CROAGUNK,[CURIOUS] 
10,18,127,DAWN,"Okay g*ng, let's do our Aipom cheer! "
10,18,128,"BUNEARY, PIPLUP",[EXCITED]

10,18,141,ASH,Uh oh. 
10,18,142,DAWN,Geodude blocked the Focus Punch! 
10,18,143,ROARK,Seismic Toss!

10,18,149,ASH,Dodge! 
10,18,150,AIPOM,[DODGING] 
10,18,151,ROARK,"Aipom, too? "
10,18,152,AIPOM,[DETERMINED] 
10,18,153,DAWN,Aipom used that move as well as Pikachu! 
10,18,154,BROCK,Excellent! Great speed and timing! 
10,18,155,ASH,"All right, Aipom. Focus Punch! "
10,18,156,AIPOM,[FOCUS PUNCH MOVE] 
10,18,157,ROARK,What happened? 
10,18,158,GEODUDE,[DAZED] 
10,18,159,IAN,Geodude cannot battle! Aipom wins! 
10,18,160,ASH,"All right, Aipom! Way to go! "
10,18,161,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
10,18,162,AIPOM,[PLEASED] 
10,18,163,DAWN,That's two wins. in a row! 
10,18,164,BROCK,Yup! There's no doubt Ash and his team are looking really good right now! 
10,18,165,BROCK,But... Both Pikachu and Aipom have got to be feeling exhausted after all of that intense battling. 
10,18,166,BROCK,"While it's true Ash is up two to zero right now, don't forget Roark's last Pokémon. "
10,18,167,DAWN,Right! 
10,18,168,ROARK,"Ash, most impressive! The way you've taken some serious disadvantages and turned them around is worthy of note! Great strategy indeed! "
10,18,169,ROARK,But remember you haven't won until you've defeated my third Pokémon as well! 
10,18,170,ASH,I know! And I'm ready too! 
10,18,171,ROARK,Well time will tell the tale! Go Rampardos! 
10,18,172,RAMPARDOS,[APPEARING] 
10,18,173,ASH,Here we go! Time to get busy! 
10,18,174,RAMPARDOS,[GROWLING]

10,18,176,ASH,"Swift, go! "
10,18,177,AIPOM,[SWIFT MOVE] 
10,18,178,DAWN,Why won't Rampardos move? 
10,18,179,AIPOM,[CONFUSED] 
10,18,180,DAWN,It's like nothing happened at all! 
10,18,181,BROCK,I knew it wouldn't do much damage but Rampardos didn't even get a scratch! 
10,18,182,ASH,"Oh man, how am I going to get past Rampardos's defense? "
10,18,183,ROARK,"I think now it's our turn. Rampardos, use Head Butt! "
10,18,184,ASH,Aipom! Dodge it! 
10,18,185,"ASH, AIPOM",[SCARED]

10,18,190,DAWN,How fast can you get? 
10,18,191,BROCK,"I was sure Rampardos would be stronger after evolving, but I never expected this! "
10,18,192,ROARK,"Impressive, don't you think? "
10,18,193,ROARK,Real power is a sight to behold! 
10,18,194,ROARK,I suggest you start putting that special training to good use now! 
10,18,195,DAWN,"Wow, you were right when you said though Ash is up by two it wasn't over 'til it's over. "
10,18,196,BROCK,It's like he's giving Ash a test. 
10,18,197,DAWN,A test? 
10,18,198,BROCK,This is exactly what any good Gym Leader does. Take the challenger to the edge! With just one move... 
10,18,199,BROCK,.Roark has turned Ash's advantage completely around! Additional pressure Ash is going to have to deal with! Which of course is a vital part of Roark's job! 
10,18,200,ASH,"Okay, will you get in there, Pikachu? "
10,18,201,PIKACHU,[DETERMINED]

10,18,205,JAMES,There's enough square footage in this place to hide a strip mall! 
10,18,206,MEOWTH,Take the energy from your mouth and put it in your feet and we'll find the b*ttlefield in no time! 
10,18,207,CROAGUNK,[CROAKING]

10,18,210,JAMES,Seeing that face is such a treat and my how time flies! 
10,18,211,MEOWTH,We're not here to steal any Pokémon I wouldn't tell you no lies! 
10,18,212,ASH,Pikachu! Thunderbolt! 
10,18,213,PIKACHU,[THUNDERBOLT MOVE] 
10,18,214,ROARK,Dodge and do Zen Headbutt!

10,18,227,RAMPARDOS,[HEAD BUTT MOVE] 
10,18,228,ROARK,[SURPRISED] 
10,18,229,BROCK,So Pikachu rotates head over heels instead of spinning just like a top and that works too! 
10,18,230,DAWN,Amazing! It's awesome what you can accomplish when you knuckle down and work really hard! 
10,18,231,ROARK,That Ash! Using a new move in the midst of all this! But it won't be enough! Throw Pikachu off using your tail! 
10,18,232,RAMPARDOS,[att*ck] 
10,18,233,PIKACHU,[SURPRISED] 
10,18,234,ASH,"Hang in there! Now, use Iron Tail! "

10,18,248,ASH,"Hey, you were great! You deserve a nice long rest. "
10,18,249,DAWN,"Wow, what a way to lose and after all that intense work learning new ways to dodge. "
10,18,250,BROCK,Now Turtwig's the only one left. 
10,18,251,BROCK,Ash's success totally depends on the way he uses Turtwig's Grass-type att*cks. 
10,18,252,JAMES,"Come clean, Croagunk. "
10,18,253,MEOWTH,If something's on your mind. 
10,18,254,JESSIE,"Small though it may be, say it! Aha! You want to ask us if you can be a part of our glorious team now don't you? You may be strange but that's no reason to be shy. "
10,18,255,CROAGUNK,[att*ck] 
10,18,256,JESSIE,No... shy is.. good. 
10,18,257,JAMES,Sorry to run but there's a hospital nearby!

10,18,263,ROARK,Well! You're quite a spirited one now aren't you? 
10,18,264,ROARK,All right! It all boils down to this! -

10,18,266,ROARK,Rampardos! Head Butt! 
10,18,267,ASH,"Turtwig, get up and over! "
10,18,268,TURTWIG,[EXERTION] 
10,18,269,ROARK,I think you've forgotten Rampardos' tail. Use it on Turtwig! 
10,18,270,RAMPARDOS,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,18,271,ASH,"We didn't forget a thing. Now, Turtwig! Bite Rampardos' tail! "
10,18,272,TURTWIG,[EXERTION] 
10,18,273,TURTWIG,[CHOMPING] 
10,18,274,ASH,Yeah! Give it a toss! 
10,18,275,TURTWIG,[EXERTION] 
10,18,276,ROARK,Oh no! 
10,18,277,DAWN,Turtwig actually threw Rampardos? 
10,18,278,BROCK,Big things come in small packages! 
10,18,279,ASH,"Razor Leaf, go! "
10,18,280,TURTWIG,[RAZOR LEAF MOVE] 
10,18,281,ROARK,Use Flamethrower! 
10,18,282,RAMPARDOS,[FLAMETHROWER MOVE] 
10,18,283,ASH,No good! We're too far away for Razor Leaf to work! 
10,18,284,RAMPARDOS,[TAUNTING] 
10,18,285,ROARK,"How about this? Use Head Smash, Rampardos, now! "
10,18,286,RAMPARDOS,[HEAD SMASH MOVE] 
10,18,287,DAWN,That sounds strong! 
10,18,288,BROCK,And that's an understatement! 
10,18,289,ASH,Turtwig! Don't move 'til I say! 
10,18,290,RAMPARDOS,[HEAD SMASH MOVE] 
10,18,291,ASH,Now quick! Use Razor Leaf! 
10,18,292,TURTWIG,[RAZOR LEAF MOVE] 
10,18,293,TURTWIG,[PAINED] 
10,18,294,ASH,"Turtwig, no! "
10,18,295,PIKACHU,[CONCERNED] 
10,18,296,TURTWIG,[PAINED] 
10,18,297,ASH,You okay? 
10,18,298,TURTWIG,[WEAK] 
10,18,299,DAWN,"Brock, do you think there's any hope? "
10,18,300,BROCK,"We still don't know if there'll be any after shock from Rampardos's Head Smash, so either side could win it! "
10,18,301,ASH,Turtwig use Synthesis! 
10,18,302,TURTWIG,[SYNTHESIS MOVE] 
10,18,303,RAMPARDOS,[DETERMINED]

10,18,306,ASH,Way to go! 
10,18,307,TURTWIG,[PANTING] 
10,18,308,ASH,"At this point, all I can do is try and use Razor Leaf from far away! "
10,18,309,ASH,But how are we going to win this with Rampardos' awesome speed and - and that Flamethrower? 
10,18,310,ASH,That's it! 
10,18,311,ASH,Turtwig! Use Razor Leaf while you run! 
10,18,312,TURTWIG,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,18,313,ROARK,"Turtwig's too far away for that! Now, Rampardos Flamethrower! "
10,18,314,RAMPARDOS,[FLAMETHROWER MOVE] 
10,18,315,ASH,Keep that Razor Leaf going! Don't you let up! 
10,18,316,TURTWIG,[DETERMINED] 
10,18,317,ROARK,You really think you can defeat us like that? All right Rampardos go!

10,18,322,ROARK,"Of course! Ash has just been camouflaging Turtwig the whole time! Let's switch to Zen Headbutt, Rampardos, now! "
10,18,323,RAMPARDOS,[ZEN HEADBUTT MOVE] 
10,18,324,ASH,Stop Razor Leaf and now do a revolving jump! 
10,18,325,RAMPARDOS,[ZEN HEADBUTT MOVE]

10,18,329,TURTWIG,[PLEASED]

10,18,333,ROARK,Rampardos! 
10,18,334,RAMPARDOS,[PAINED] [DAZED] 
10,18,335,IAN,Rampardos can't battle and Turtwig is the winner! The victory goes to Ash of Pallet Town! 
10,18,336,ASH,Turtwig we did it! You were so awesome! 
10,18,337,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
10,18,338,DAWN,All right Ash really won it! Those new moves ended up paying off in a big way after all! 
10,18,339,BROCK,"Amazing how quickly Turtwig got comfortable with them! Quite a battle eh, Croagunk? "
10,18,340,CROAGUNK,[AGREEING] 
10,18,341,ROARK,The way you adapted quickly to changing conditions was just amazing! 
10,18,342,ROARK,So! Here's proof of your Oreburgh Gym victory! - 
10,18,343,ROARK,The Coal Badge! - 
10,18,344,ASH,Wow! 
10,18,345,PIKACHU,[HAPPY] 
10,18,346,ASH,Thank you so much Roark! All right! We just got the Coal Badge! 
10,18,347,TURTWIG,[EXCITED] 
10,18,348,NARRATOR,"Getting that first Gym Badge is always a challenge, but to our hero in the Sinnoh region it's now reality! However, requiring seven additional badges to compete in the Sinnoh League, you can be sure there's plenty of excitement yet to come, so stay tuned to make sure you don't miss one thrill-packed second! TO BE CONTINUED.."
10,17,0,NARRATOR,"After witnessing Paul's impressive victory at the Oreburgh Gym, Ash waged his premiere Gym Battle in the Sinnoh Region against Roark, the Oreburgh Gym leader, battling with fierce tenacity as he teamed up with his Aipom, Turtwig, and finally Pikachu. However, the end result of our Hero's efforts was not to be the same as Paul's, when Ash's hard fought battle against Roark ended in a mind-boggling defeat!

10,17,18,BROCK,"Using that coal ore for training was a really great idea, Ash. "
10,17,19,DAWN,"Yeah, with so many different kinds of rocks around it looks like you made the perfect choice! "
10,17,20,ASH,Thanks! Just look at how psyched everyone is! 
10,17,21,ASH,Now we keep training until we can do it in our sleep and that badge is ours! 
10,17,22,DAWN,"But Ash, they aren't really the best match ups for the Rock-types at Oreburgh Gym, if you know what I mean. "
10,17,23,ASH,"Yeah, except for Turtwig. "
10,17,24,DAWN,Hey I know! Call your friend! The T.V. Pokémon poet. 
10,17,25,ASH,"Dawn, Professor Oak's a professor! "
10,17,26,DAWN,That's the guy! Doesn't Professor Oak have a whole bunch of different Pokémon? 
10,17,27,DAWN,Just call and ask him to send you some of yours that are strong against Rock-types! Or I could lend you Piplup. 
10,17,28,ASH,Nope! I'm sticking with the Pokémon I have. 
10,17,29,DAWN,But Ash... Don't you want to win? 
10,17,30,ASH,Of course I want to win! 
10,17,31,ASH,"Look, I don't need to change Pokémon to b*at Roark. "
10,17,32,ASH,Doesn't matter who you're up against. 
10,17,33,ASH,There's always a way to win it! 
10,17,34,ASH,"You see, we're a team and we'll stay as a team! "
10,17,35,DAWN,"But, they're just not the right type of Pokémon. "
10,17,36,ASH,Look at Paul. He didn't have the 'right' type of Pokémon either. But did 
10,17,37,ASH,"Well if he can do it, then I know I can do it too! "
10,17,38,ASH,"So guys! Let's win it at the Oreburgh Gym, but we'll do it our way! "
10,17,39,PIKACHU,[DETERMINED] 
10,17,40,AIPOM,[DETERMINED] 
10,17,41,TURTWIG,[DETERMINED] 
10,17,42,DAWN,Silly me. I don't know what I was thinking. 
10,17,43,BROCK,I do have an idea. The perfect training partner for what you're going to be up against! - 
10,17,44,ASH,What do you mean Brock? - 
10,17,45,BROCK,Sudowoodo! Let's go! 
10,17,46,SUDOWOODO,[APPEARING] 
10,17,47,SUDOWOODO,[GREETING] 
10,17,48,DAWN,Wait - I don't get it. 
10,17,49,ASH,Sudowoodo can use Rock Head! 
10,17,50,BROCK,That's right! As we all remember Rock Head is an Ability that makes Pokémon immune to the recoil of moves like Double Edge and which can save you a lot of damage in the long run! 
10,17,51,DAWN,That's the same Special Ability that Roark's Onix has! 
10,17,52,BROCK,Exactly right! You train hard against Sudowoodo and I guarantee you'll have some insights on how to win at the Oreburgh Gym! 
10,17,53,ASH,"That's great Brock, thanks! Hey guys, what do you say we get down to it? "
10,17,54,PIKACHU,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,17,55,AIPOM,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,17,56,TURTWIG,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,17,57,DAWN,All right! Just watching you has gotten me totally psyched as well! 
10,17,58,DAWN,We're going to go back to the Pokémon Center and start to work on some new combinations I've been thinking about for a while! 
10,17,59,ASH,Good for you! I'm sure they'll be great! 
10,17,60,DAWN,And good luck with all your training! 
10,17,61,DAWN,Come on Piplup and Buneary! Let's go! 
10,17,62,BUNEARY,[EXCITED] 
10,17,63,MARIAN,Here's the site of the next Pokémon Contest! 
10,17,64,MARIAN,That exciting event will be held in Floaroma Town - be there! It's a beautiful location that's not to be missed! 
10,17,65,MARIAN,So for all of you Coordinators out there - beginners up through seasoned pros - I urge you all not to miss this one! 
10,17,66,MARIAN,"We'll be there,and we hope you will too! "
10,17,67,DAWN,"Wow, Floaroma Town! Don't you worry, Marian, I'll be there for my ribbon! "
10,17,68,KENZO,No way! 
10,17,69,KENZO,They couldn't have stolen it. 
10,17,70,ASSISTANT ,The Fossil Restorer must have been taken after we went home. 
10,17,71,KENZO,What about the revived Pokémon? 
10,17,72,ASSISTANT ,They're all fine. 
10,17,73,ASSISTANT ,There was no damage to the fossils in the storeroom either. 
10,17,74,KENZO,We'd better get in touch with Officer Jenny right away! 
10,17,75,ASSISTANT ,Right! 
10,17,76,KENZO,Well... 
10,17,77,KENZO,At least none of the Pokémon were injured during this awful ordeal. 
10,17,78,ASSISTANT ,Except. there was a Pokémon inside. 
10,17,79,KENZO,You're right! 
10,17,80,KENZO,We were in the process of restoring a Pokémon! 
10,17,81,KENZO,"If it completes...and then, somehow it gets loose! "
10,17,82,JESSIE,Cheers! 
10,17,83,JESSIE,Talk about being restored! 
10,17,84,JAMES,So to speak! 
10,17,85,MEOWTH,Stealing the Fossil Restorer is going to restore our rep! 
10,17,86,JESSIE,"First we dig a hole, now we're on a roll! "
10,17,87,JAMES,Whenever we hark back to doing what we do best the rest is history! 
10,17,88,MEOWTH,Okay! Let's fling fossils in there 'til it's full! 
10,17,89,JESSIE,It's like putting money in the bank! 
10,17,90,JAMES,We'll fill Sinnoh with ever so many fabulous fossils it isn't even funny! 
10,17,91,JESSIE,"James, show us the first one. "
10,17,92,JAMES,Meowth has it! 
10,17,93,MEOWTH,You got the wrong guy! It's Jess! 
10,17,94,JESSIE,Hold on! Finishing the fossil was your job! 
10,17,95,JAMES,I was in charge of machine maintenance! 
10,17,96,MEOWTH,I was in charge of hole maintenance! 
10,17,97,JESSIE,The one in your head? 
10,17,98,WOBBUFFET,[AMUSED] 
10,17,99,JESSIE,You always mess up my brilliant ideas! 
10,17,100,JAMES,But brilliant ideas come from ME! 
10,17,101,MEOWTH,You wouldn't know one if it bit ya! 
10,17,102,JESSIE,A pre-fab fossil? 
10,17,103,JAMES,It appears to have been placed in times past. 
10,17,104,MEOWTH,And it looks like it's finished baking! 
10,17,105,JESSIE,Then that means... - 
10,17,106,JESSIE,All done! - 
10,17,107,JAMES,What's old is new! 
10,17,108,MEOWTH,It's a fossil coup! 
10,17,109,AERODACTYL,[GROWL] 
10,17,110,AERODACTYL,[ROAR] 
10,17,111,JAMES,Woo hoo! 
10,17,112,MEOWTH,It's an Aerodactyl Pokémon for me and you! 
10,17,113,JESSIE,Without further ado... 
10,17,114,JESSIE,Go. Poké Ball! 
10,17,115,AERODACTYL,[GROWL] 
10,17,116,AERODACTYL,[IRRITATED]

10,17,120,AERODACTYL,[ROAR] 
10,17,121,JESSIE,James. what is that? 
10,17,122,JAMES,Hold on. Let me see. 
10,17,123,AERODACTYL,[ROAR] 
10,17,124,JAMES,I'm almost there. 
10,17,125,AERODACTYL,[ROAR] 
10,17,126,JAMES,Yes! Here it is! That move's been dubbed Giga Impact! 
10,17,127,MEOWTH,"Hey, catchy name! "
10,17,128,JESSIE,Well that name's our claim to fame! 
10,17,129,MEOWTH,No Aerodactyl's going to give me the brush off! 
10,17,130,AERODACTYL,[ROAR] 
10,17,131,JAMES,It's winging its way to town! - 
10,17,132,JESSIE,Shall we? - 
10,17,133,JAMES,Let's! 
10,17,134,MEOWTH,"Hey, hold the phone! "
10,17,135,MEOWTH,Before we head back into that Oiban sprawl let's crank out a few fossils to take along! 
10,17,136,JESSIE,"Say, long range! "
10,17,137,JAMES,And they said Meowth was strange. 
10,17,138,MEOWTH,"So first off, it's time to do a little Pokey-show prep! "
10,17,139,ASH,Turtwig! Razor Leaf now!

10,17,145,TURTWIG,[LANDING][CHALLENGING] 
10,17,146,ASH,"Turtwig's moves have gotten a lot stronger, but that's still not enough! "
10,17,147,ASH,The Rock-type Pokémon at the Oreburgh Gym have tons of speed and power. 
10,17,148,ASH,I've got to figure out how to deal with that! 
10,17,149,ASH,"And just fighting back with pure power, that's not the the answer either! "
10,17,150,BROCK,"Hey, Ash! "
10,17,151,BROCK,"Hey, how about a break? The Pokémon are feeling kinda wiped out. "
10,17,152,ASH,"Yeah, you're right. "
10,17,153,ROARK,You are working hard! 
10,17,154,"SUDOWOODO, TURTWIG, PIKACHU, AIPOM",[SURPRISED] 
10,17,155,ASH,"Hey, Roark! "
10,17,156,ROARK,Rock as far as the eye can see! It is a great way for you to get ready for another battle in my Gym! 
10,17,157,ASH,And you can be sure we're working super hard! 
10,17,158,ROARK,Just don't work too hard. You simply figure out a strategy that suits you and your Pokémon as well! 
10,17,159,ASH,Okay!But I was just thinking about the way you fought Paul... 
10,17,160,ROARK,Hang on a sec! 
10,17,161,ROARK,This has been eating at me since our last battle. Just who is it you're trying to b*at anyway? 
10,17,162,ASH,Oh that! Uh. 
10,17,163,ROARK,"Right. It's understandable that you'd be concerned about Paul, but it's not Paul you're going to be battling with, it's me, right? "
10,17,164,ASH,Yeah! I hear you! 
10,17,165,ROARK,Good. You'll be fine! And I've got some serious digging to do! 
10,17,166,ASH,"What, now? "
10,17,167,BROCK,"Looking for fossils, right? "
10,17,168,ROARK,"Right! I've always loved ancient Pokémon, like that! "
10,17,169,ROARK,I found that Cranidos fossil when I was just a kid and so I had to have it restored! - 
10,17,170,ASH,You restored it? - 
10,17,171,ROARK,"Yeah, we sure did! What an amazing thing to restore Pokémon Fossils! "
10,17,172,ROARK,"Thing is, Cranidos was the first Pokémon we used it on. "
10,17,173,ASH,Awesome! Amazing what science can do! 
10,17,174,ROARK,Yeah. but these fossils are more amazing. 
10,17,175,ROARK,You see Pokémon have been changing in a process that's been taking place for millions of years to get to this point. 
10,17,176,ROARK,It's almost as if these fossils have come back to tell me all about their ancient secrets. 
10,17,177,ROARK,Yeah. fossils are as beautiful as it gets! 
10,17,178,BUNEARY,[HAPPY] 
10,17,179,PIPLUP,[HAPPY]

10,17,189,TRAINER A ,Was that an Aerodactyl? 
10,17,190,DAWN,How could that be? 
10,17,191,POKEDEX,"Aerodactyl. The Fossil Pokémon. An Ancient Flying-type, it is equipped with sharp, saw-like teeth. "
10,17,192,TRAINER A,But how? It couldn't have escaped from the museum right? 
10,17,193,DAWN,The museum? 
10,17,194,AERODACTYL,[ROAR] 
10,17,195,KENZO,You hear that sound? 
10,17,196,ASSISTANT ,Sure do! Aerodactyl's in a rage! 
10,17,197,KENZO,Aerodactyl? 
10,17,198,AERODACTYL,[att*ck] 
10,17,199,KENZO,Oh no! It had to come from the restored fossil!

10,16,0,NARRATOR,"Because our Heroes had arrived at the Oreburgh Gym just after Paul did, Ash waited his turn to challenge Roark the Oreburgh Gym Leader by watching Paul's challenge first!

10,16,5,DAWN,ALL RIGHT - TIME OUT! 
10,16,6,DAWN,You've already battled Ash once - why not stay and watch? 
10,16,7,DAWN,What - what's wrong? 
10,16,8,PAUL,What's wrong? Who're you? 
10,16,9,DAWN,"Excuse me, your rudeness, but we met once before. The name's Dawn! "
10,16,10,PAUL,Don't remember. 
10,16,11,DAWN,"You think you're funny, don't you? "
10,16,12,DAWN,"Listen, mister! You nasty, insulting, spoiled brat apologize! "
10,16,13,ROARK,You're welcome to stay. 
10,16,14,PAUL,With that enthusiasm how can I refuse? 
10,16,15,ASH,Good! And I'm going to show you a whole new style of battling! 
10,16,16,ASH,"Whenever you're ready, Roark, I am! "
10,16,17,ROARK,Ash would you mind terribly if we had our battle tomorrow? 
10,16,18,ROARK,You know my Pokémon and I just went through some serious battling and to tell you the truth we're exhausted! 
10,16,19,ASH,I hear you. Hey tomorrow'll be just fine! 
10,16,20,ROARK,"Great! Thank you, Ash! "
10,16,21,JESSIE,Look. Is that a fossil I see?

10,16,33,JESSIE,Putting the do - gooders in their place! 
10,16,34,JAMES,Because we're Team Rocket! 
10,16,35,MEOWTH,In your face! 
10,16,36,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,16,37,JAMES,Science lovers! We are now in the Oreburgh Mining Museum where folks divide their time between the history of coal mining and the mystery of Ancient Pokémon! 
10,16,38,JESSIE,And lots of cool stuff to steal! 
10,16,39,MEOWTH,I suggest we stretch our brains by doing some Pokey - research first! 
10,16,40,WOBBUFFET,[AGREEING] 
10,16,41,JESSIE,If that's what I think. 
10,16,42,JAMES,It's enough coal to light the Boss's house for a week! 
10,16,43,KENZO,It was mined with cooperation between humans and Pokémon. 
10,16,44,JAMES,"Uh, have we met? "
10,16,45,KENZO,My name is Kenzo and I'm one of the researchers here at the museum! And I'll bet I know who you are. 
10,16,46,KENZO,"You're Dr. Jessa, Dr. Jamus and Dr. Meows the Ancient Pokémon experts! "
10,16,47,JESSIE,True! 
10,16,48,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,16,49,KENZO,"It's an honor to finally meet. So now, why don't you tell me what part of our museum you'd like to look at first. "
10,16,50,JESSIE,The best part of course!! 
10,16,51,JAMES,The Fossil Restorer!! 
10,16,52,MEOWTH,Word up! 
10,16,53,WOBBUFFET,[AGREEING] 
10,16,54,KENZO,"Well, of course! Follow me. It's in the research tower right next door! "
10,16,55,KENZO,Our museum is comprised of two parts - the main building which houses all of our exhibits and the research tower. 
10,16,56,KENZO,Our activities in the research tower are just what the name implies - we research Ancient Pokémon and their abilities. 
10,16,57,KENZO,.in order to gain a deeper understanding of Pokémon development. 
10,16,58,KENZO,"And over our many long years of painstaking work, we have developed a technology that actually restores fossilized Pokémon - bringing them completely back to life, and in full health! "
10,16,59,JESSIE,Wow! You have been busy! 
10,16,60,JAMES,A bit bigger than Pikachu. 
10,16,61,MEOWTH,We'll steal it anyway!! 
10,16,62,WOBBUFFET,[AGREEING] 
10,16,63,KENZO,The restored Pokémon are then placed in a time - appropriate environment. 
10,16,64,KENZO,All located within this dome!

10,16,69,ASH,Okay I know you all want to get out of this place as soon as you can but I can only use three of you right now! 
10,16,70,BROCK,Try and understand that out of all of you the only Pokémon good for battling a Rock type is Turtwig who's a Grass type! 
10,16,71,TURTWIG ,[EXCITED] 
10,16,72,ASH,"And I'm counting on you and your Razor Leaf, Turtwig! "
10,16,73,TURTWIG,[PLEASED] 
10,16,74,ASH,Of course it is true that Aipom's Focus Punch is really powerful too. 
10,16,75,AIPOM,[HAPPY]

10,16,77,ASH,So! I guess that means I choose all three of you!

10,16,84,STARAVIA,[UPSET] 
10,16,85,DAWN,A promise is a promise! Don't worry! 
10,16,86,ASH,And that's when Dawn's mom says she worries the most. 
10,16,87,DAWN,What did you say? 
10,16,88,BROCK,Calm down! One thing I learned from watching Paul's battle with Roark was Paul's speed making up a huge part of the secret to his victory! 
10,16,89,BROCK,"Of course his choice of moves was important too, but I think that amazing speed put him over the top! "
10,16,90,ASH,"So do I. The thing is, what do we do? "
10,16,91,PAUL,Now that should be a no-brainer just imitate me! 
10,16,92,DAWN,[SURPRISED] 
10,16,93,ASH,I'd never do what you do! I wouldn't force Chimchar to battle the way you did for a million BUCKS! 
10,16,94,BOY A,"Hey.wow! Thanks a lot for the Azumarill, mister! We'll train real hard! So see you! "
10,16,95,ASH,You gave him Azumarill?! - 
10,16,96,PAUL,"Yeah, so? - "
10,16,97,ASH,Because it lost? 
10,16,98,PAUL,That's as good as that Azumarill's going to get. 
10,16,99,ASH,"I thought it was your friend! You could have kept training, you know. "
10,16,100,PAUL,"No, that one was a lost cause. "
10,16,101,ASH,I don't get you.! 
10,16,102,PAUL,And I thought you wanted to win! 
10,16,103,ASH,"I do, but not the way you go about doing it! "
10,16,104,ASH,He'll never b*at me again! 
10,16,105,ASH,"All right, let's show that Paul there are other ways to win a battle than the way he does it! "
10,16,106,PIKACHU,[INSPIRED] 
10,16,107,BROCK,What's wrong? 
10,16,108,DAWN,I guess they're just different kinds of trainers. I just wonder what Chimchar and Elekid think of Paul... 
10,16,109,JESSIE,Well we can't just hide it under our coats. 
10,16,110,JAMES,They might've been nice and helped us by making the Fossil Restoration Machine the size of a deck of cards. 
10,16,111,JAMES,Oh but no they couldn't do that! 
10,16,112,MEOWTH,We're stealing that monstrosity if I have to carry it out on my back! 
10,16,113,MEOWTH,There's way too much dough in bringing Ancient Pokeymon onto the modern market. 
10,16,114,WOBBUFFET,[AGREEING] 
10,16,115,KENZO,Let me show you the restoration process. 
10,16,116,KENZO,The fossil is placed here. 
10,16,117,KENZO,...and over a period of the next  hours the restoration will take place! 
10,16,118,KENZO,We currently have  machines at our disposal. 
10,16,119,KENZO,Aah! Good timing! It seems Omanyte is complete! 
10,16,120,OMANYTE,[GREETING] 
10,16,121,AMES, hours between famine and feast! 
10,16,122,JESSIE,Riches for us to say the least! 
10,16,123,MEOWTH,While they get fleeced! 
10,16,124,MEOWTH,No more making our own machines that all just end up going blooey anyway! 
10,16,125,JAMES,Dig a few fossils and suddenly it's pay day! 
10,16,126,WOBBUFFET,[EXCITED] 
10,16,127,JESSIE,Hold on! We won't even have to lift up a single shovel! They have fossils. 
10,16,128,JAMES,You're right! There're enough fossils here to keep us restoring right through the next year! 
10,16,129,MEOWTH,"Like baking cookies! Except, when you sell those cookies all you get is a few bucks but not with fossils right? "
10,16,130,JESSIE,Out of sight! 
10,16,131,MEOWTH,We're conquering Sinnoh with all of our might! 
10,16,132,JESSIE,Sweet delight! 
10,16,133,MEOWTH,And once the Team Rocket flag's flapping from sea to shining Sinnoh sea I just know the Boss'll be happily bawling like a Boss baby! - 
10,16,134,JESSIE,This is our quest. - 
10,16,135,JAMES,To be the best! 
10,16,136,MEOWTH,And b*at the rest! 
10,16,137,WOBBUFFET,[EXCITED] 
10,16,138,JESSIE,"Now, time's a wasting so hurry up What's your plan?! "
10,16,139,JAMES,Micro-managing again are you? 
10,16,140,WOBBUFFET,[ANNOYED] 
10,16,141,ROARK,I trust you had a good night's sleep and are ready to go? 
10,16,142,ASH,Yeah! 
10,16,143,PIKACHU,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,16,144,ROARK,Good! My Pokémon did too and are in tip-top shape so feel free to give it all you've got! 
10,16,145,ASH,"Great! Get a load of this, Paul! "
10,16,146,ASH,Some real battling! 
10,16,147,IAN,The Gym Battle between Ash the challenger and Roark the Gym Leader is about to begin! 
10,16,148,IAN,Each side will have the use of  Pokémon and the battle is over when all of either side's Pokémon are defeated! 
10,16,149,IAN,"In addition, only the challenger is allowed to make any substitutions! "
10,16,150,BROCK,Ash's first Sinnoh battle is here. - 
10,16,151,DAWN,Ooh I can't wait! - 
10,16,152,IAN,Let the battle begin! 
10,16,153,ROARK,"Cranidos, let's go! "
10,16,154,CRANIDOS,[APPEARING] 
10,16,155,ASH,Why's he doing that? 
10,16,156,PIKACHU,[CONFUSED] 
10,16,157,DAWN,I was so sure Roark was going to save Cranidos for last but instead he's starting with it! 
10,16,158,BROCK,By switching up the order of his Pokémon Roark's testing Ash's reaction to surprise situations. It's a common technique in these kinds of matches. 
10,16,159,DAWN,"Wow, hope Ash's okay. "
10,16,160,ASH,I don't care anyway! Roark's got Rock type Pokémon. I'll just take them down one at a time! 
10,16,161,ASH,But I still have to deal with Cranidos' speed and that Head Butt. 
10,16,162,ROARK,And which Pokémon have you chosen? 
10,16,163,ASH,Okay Aipom. I choose you! 
10,16,164,AIPOM,[APPEARING] 
10,16,165,ASH,"Here we go, Aipom! I'm counting on you to confuse Cranidos with your quick moves! "
10,16,166,ASH,"Aipom, use Focus Punch now! "
10,16,167,AIPOM,[FOCUS PUNCH MOVE] 
10,16,168,ROARK,Head Butt! 
10,16,169,CRANIDOS,[HEAD BUTT MOVE] 
10,16,170,BROCK,A good move by Ash! He got Aipom up in the air right off the bat! 
10,16,171,BROCK,That gives them the advantage over Cranidos stuck on the ground. 
10,16,172,AIPOM,[FOCUS PUNCH MOVE] 
10,16,173,ASH,Do it! 
10,16,174,AIPOM,[FOCUS PUNCH MOVE] 
10,16,175,CRANIDOS,[HEAD BUTT MOVE] 
10,16,176,ASH,Oh no! 
10,16,177,AIPOM,[STARTLED] 
10,16,178,CRANIDOS,[HEAD BUTT MOVE] 
10,16,179,AIPOM,[PAINED] 
10,16,180,CRANIDOS,[DETERMINED] 
10,16,181,DAWN,I knew Cranidos had great speed but I had no idea it could jump like that too! 
10,16,182,BROCK,And that means it's going to be a tough battle whether they're both on the ground or in the air! 
10,16,183,ASH,"Aipom, get up! "
10,16,184,PIKACHU,[ENCOURAGING] 
10,16,185,AIPOM,[DETERMINED] 
10,16,186,ROARK,Cranidos use Flamethrower now! 
10,16,187,CRANIDOS,[FLAMETHROWER MOVE] 
10,16,188,ASH,Double Team! 
10,16,189,AIPOM [],[DOUBLE TEAM MOVE] 
10,16,190,ASH,Aipom use Swift! 
10,16,191,AIPOM,[SWIFT MOVE] 
10,16,192,ROARK,Dodge it! 
10,16,193,CRANIDOS,[EXERTION] 
10,16,194,ASH,Focus Punch! 
10,16,195,AIPOM,[FOCUS PUNCH MOVE] 
10,16,196,ROARK,Zen Headbutt go! 
10,16,197,CRANIDOS,[ZEN HEADBUTT MOVE] 
10,16,198,AIPOM,[FOCUS PUNCH MOVE] 
10,16,199,CRANIDOS,[ZEN HEADBUTT MOVE] 
10,16,200,AIPOM,[FOCUS PUNCH MOVE] 
10,16,201,CRANIDOS,[DETERMINED] 
10,16,202,AIPOM,[DAZED] 
10,16,203,IAN,Aipom's unable to battle! Cranidos wins it! 
10,16,204,CRANIDOS,[PLEASED] 
10,16,205,ASH,"You were awesome, Aipom, now go and take a good long rest! "
10,16,206,DAWN,Aipom tried hard. 
10,16,207,BROCK,At least it gave Ash the opportunity to check out the way Cranidos moves which you can be sure he'll be remembering from here on out! 
10,16,208,ROARK,"Okay, Ash have you decided on your next Pokémon? "
10,16,209,ASH,"Okay, Pikachu you're up! "
10,16,210,PIKACHU,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,16,211,PIKACHU,[DETERMINED] 
10,16,212,ASH,"Let's show 'em Pikachu, Thunderbolt now! "
10,16,213,PIKACHU,[THUNDERBOLT MOVE] 
10,16,214,ROARK,Dodge then Zen Headbutt! 
10,16,215,CRANIDOS,[DODGING][ZEN HEADBUTT MOVE] 
10,16,216,BROCK,Oh no! Aipom's Focus Punch should've worn Cranidos down! 
10,16,217,PIKACHU,[SCARED] 
10,16,218,ASH,"Here it comes! Iron Tail, let's go! "
10,16,219,PIKACHU,[IRON TAIL MOVE] 
10,16,220,CRANIDOS,[PAINED] 
10,16,221,ASH,All right! - 
10,16,222,DAWN,Bullseye! - 
10,16,223,BROCK,That did the trick! 
10,16,224,ROARK,"Excellent! A well placed hit! Cranidos, Head Butt! "
10,16,225,CRANIDOS,[HEAD BUTT MOVE] 
10,16,226,ASH,Dodge and use Thunderbolt! 
10,16,227,PIKACHU,[DODGE] 
10,16,228,CRANIDOS,[HEAD BUTT MOVE] 
10,16,229,PIKACHU,[PAINED] 
10,16,230,ASH,You can do it Pikachu. Use Thunderbolt! 
10,16,231,PIKACHU,[THUNDERBOLT MOVE] 
10,16,232,ROARK,"Zen Headbutt, quick! "
10,16,233,CRANIDOS,[ZEN HEADBUTT MOVE] 
10,16,234,PIKACHU,[PAINED] 
10,16,235,ASH,"Whoa, that Cranidos is so fast it b*at us to the punch! - "
10,16,236,ROARK,Now use Head Butt! - 
10,16,237,ASH,"Pikachu, Dodge it! "
10,16,238,CRANIDOS,[HEAD BUTT MOVE] 
10,16,239,PIKACHU,[PAINED] 
10,16,240,ASH,"Pikachu no! Those att*cks that Headbutt. Zen Headbutt, man! "
10,16,241,ASH,How're we going to deal with those? 
10,16,242,DAWN,Cranidos is so fast! 
10,16,243,BROCK,"This is tough! Cranidos's speed, along with the power of those Head Butts are keeping Pikachu from doing much of anything! "
10,16,244,ASH,Come on Pikachu I know you can do it but you just got to hang in there! 
10,16,245,PIKACHU,[EXERTION] 
10,16,246,DAWN,Paul's leaving? 
10,16,247,ASH,What the. 
10,16,248,PIKACHU,[DETERMINED] 
10,16,249,PIKACHU,[THUNDERBOLT MOVE] 
10,16,250,ASH,Pikachu..! 
10,16,251,PIKACHU,[EXERTION] 
10,16,252,ROARK,A Pokémon defending its trainer is truly a sight to see. 
10,16,253,CRANIDOS,[AGREEING] 
10,16,254,ASH,"Okay, Pikachu, let's show them something they'll never forget! "
10,16,255,PIKACHU,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,16,256,ASH,Quick att*ck let's go! 
10,16,257,PIKACHU,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,16,258,PIKACHU,[QUICK att*ck MOVE] 
10,16,259,ROARK,"Pikachu's fast, but you mustn't forget that using Normal att*cks such as that won't do much at all against my Cranidos! Use Flamethrower! "
10,16,260,CRANIDOS,[FLAMETHROWER MOVE] 
10,16,261,ASH,Dodge and use Iron Tail! 
10,16,262,PIKACHU,[DODGING] 
10,16,263,PIKACHU,[IRON TAIL MOVE] 
10,16,264,CRANIDOS,[SURPRISED] 
10,16,265,DAWN,Wow! See that? - 
10,16,266,ROARK,That was so fast! - 
10,16,267,ASH,Do it! 
10,16,268,PIKACHU,[IRON TAIL MOVE] 
10,16,269,CRANIDOS,[PAINED] 
10,16,270,DAWN,Perfect! 
10,16,271,BROCK,Using the Quick att*ck's speed along with Iron Tail was great thinking! 
10,16,272,CRANIDOS,[DETERMINED] 
10,16,273,ASH,That should have put Cranidos away! 
10,16,274,ASH,But Cranidos is just standing there! 
10,16,275,ROARK,I like the way you combine your moves! 
10,16,276,ROARK,"But now I want you to watch this! Cranidos, Head Smash! "
10,16,277,CRANIDOS,[HEAD SMASH MOVE] 
10,16,278,ASH,Uh oh! 
10,16,279,PAUL,So Roark learned that move after all.. 
10,16,280,DAWN,That's new to me. 
10,16,281,BROCK,"Head Smash of all the Head Butt moves in Cranidos' arsenal, Head Smash is by far the strongest and most dangerous as well! Of course they're all powerful, but Head Smash can cause recoil damage too. "
10,16,282,ASH,If you're going for it then we will! Pikachu Volt Tackle now! 
10,16,283,PIKACHU,[VOLT TACKLE MOVE] 
10,16,284,DAWN,Volt Tackle? But Ash knows that it could possibly injure Pikachu! 
10,16,285,PAUL,Pathetic strategy. 
10,16,286,CRANIDOS,[HEAD SMASH MOVE] 
10,16,287,PIKACHU,[VOLT TACKLE MOVE] 
10,16,288,CRANIDOS,[HEAD SMASH MOVE] 
10,16,289,PIKACHU,[VOLT TACKLE MOVE] 
10,16,290,PIKACHU,[STUNNED] 
10,16,291,ASH,Pikachu! 
10,16,292,CRANIDOS,[DETERMINED] 
10,16,293,ROARK,"Cranidos, no! "
10,16,294,ASH,Cranidos is still standing! 
10,16,295,ROARK,As is Pikachu! You've raised your Pokémon well! 
10,16,296,ASH,Pikachu it's too dangerous for you to go on so come back here! 
10,16,297,PIKACHU,[RELIEVED] 
10,16,298,ROARK,"I can't wait to see the rest of your team! So, who will be your third Pokémon? "
10,16,299,ASH,"Turtwig, I choose you! "
10,16,300,TURTWIG,[APPEARING] 
10,16,301,ROARK,A Turtwig! That should be a real advantage in a Rock type Gym! 
10,16,302,CRANIDOS,[AGREEING] 
10,16,303,ASH,"Razor Leaf, Turtwig, go! "
10,16,304,TURTWIG,[RAZOR LEAF MOVE] 
10,16,305,ROARK,Flamethrower now! 
10,16,306,CRANIDOS,[FLAMETHROWER MOVE] 
10,16,307,ASH,"Dodge it! Then Bite, Turtwig! "
10,16,308,TURTWIG,[DODGING] 
10,16,309,OARK,Oh my! That might be the fastest Turtwig I've ever seen! 
10,16,310,PAUL,I hate to admit it but Turtwig's speed really improved. 
10,16,311,TURTWIG,[BITE MOVE] 
10,16,312,ROARK,"Zen Headbutt, go! "
10,16,313,TURTWIG,[BITE MOVE] 
10,16,314,CRANIDOS,[ZEN HEADBUTT MOVE] 
10,16,315,TURTWIG,[PAINED] 
10,16,316,BROCK,I can't believe after all this time Cranidos can still keep battling like that! 
10,16,317,ROARK,Use Flamethrower! 
10,16,318,CRANIDOS,[FLAMETHROWER MOVE] 
10,16,319,TURTWIG,[EXERTION] 
10,16,320,BROCK,A Grass type like Turtwig is vulnerable to a Flamethrower att*ck and could really get hurt! - 
10,16,321,DAWN,"Turtwig, stay strong! - "
10,16,322,ASH,Razor Leaf! 
10,16,323,TURTWIG,[RAZOR LEAF MOVE] 
10,16,324,CRANIDOS,[PAINED] 
10,16,325,CRANIDOS,[DAZED] 
10,16,326,IAN,Cranidos is unable to battle! Turtwig is the winner! 
10,16,327,TURTWIG,[PLEASED] 
10,16,328,ASH,All right! 
10,16,329,DAWN,"Wow, Turtwig was awesome! "
10,16,330,BROCK,"But don't forget, Roark has  Pokémon he hasn't brought out. "
10,16,331,ROARK,"Cranidos, rock solid! You really toughed it out! "
10,16,332,ASH,"Whoa, that's over with, but we went through way too much to defeat just  Pokémon! "
10,16,333,PIKACHU,[CALLING] 
10,16,334,PIKACHU,[ENCOURAGING] 
10,16,335,TURTWIG,[AGREEING] 
10,16,336,ASH,"It's still anyone's battle, you're right! Okay, Paul, watch this! "
10,16,337,ROARK,"All right, Ash, it's time for my second Pokémon! Let's go! "
10,16,338,ONIX,[APPEARING] 
10,16,339,TURTWIG,[DETERMINED] 
10,16,340,ASH,"I'm going to stick with Turtwig, Roark! "
10,16,341,ROARK,All right! Ready? 
10,16,342,ASH,"You bet! Turtwig, Razor Leaf, go! "
10,16,343,TURTWIG,[RAZOR LEAF MOVE] 
10,16,344,BROCK,Good one! That Razor Leaf should do a lot of damage! 
10,16,345,ROARK,Dodge then Double Edge! 
10,16,346,ONIX,[DODGING] 
10,16,347,ONIX,[DOUBLE-EDGE MOVE] 
10,16,348,TURTWIG,[PAINED]

10,16,351,ASH,Turtwig! 
10,16,352,PIKACHU,[WORRIED] 
10,16,353,DAWN,"No way, with one hit? "
10,16,354,BROCK,I guess Cranidos' Flamethrower must have done a lot more damage than I initially thought. 
10,16,355,ASH,Okay Turtwig return! You were great! So Pikachu I guess it's all up to you now! 
10,16,356,PIKACHU,[DETERMINED] 
10,16,357,ROARK,I know it's your last Pokémon but I'm not going to go easy on you! 
10,16,358,ASH,Right! Iron Tail! 
10,16,359,PIKACHU,[IRON TAIL MOVE] 
10,16,360,ROARK,A nice big Slam!

10,16,363,ONIX,[SLAM MOVE] 
10,16,364,ONIX,[PAINED] 
10,16,365,PIKACHU,[WEAK] 
10,16,366,BROCK,Iron Tail is a good matchup but I'm afraid Pikachu has pretty much reached the limit. 
10,16,367,DAWN,"Pikachu, I know you can do it! "
10,16,368,SH,"All right then, I know Electric type moves aren't going to do any damage at all on a Ground type. "
10,16,369,ASH,And what about that speed? 
10,16,370,ASH,Of course! Use Thunderbolt on the Field! 
10,16,371,PIKACHU,[THUNDERBOLT MOVE] 
10,16,372,ONIX,[SURPRISED] 
10,16,373,ROARK,"Now Onix, use Double-Edge! "
10,16,374,ONIX,[DOUBLE-EDGE MOVE] - 
10,16,375,DAWN,Brock what's going on? - 
10,16,376,BROCK,This is great! 
10,16,377,BROCK,Those rocks have slowed Onix way down! 
10,16,378,ASH,"Pikachu, Quick att*ck now! "
10,16,379,PIKACHU,[QUICK att*ck MOVE] 
10,16,380,ONIX,[PAINED]

10,16,394,IAN,"Pikachu is unable to battle! Onix is the winner, and so the victory goes to Roark the Gym Leader! "
10,16,395,ROARK,"Onix, great work! "
10,16,396,ONIX,[PLEASED] 
10,16,397,DAWN,So that's it - it's over. 
10,16,398,BROCK,It was going well up until the point when Pikachu used Thunderbolt to break up the field.... 
10,16,399,BROCK,.but who would've predicted Onix's Screech would do what it did and so quickly? 
10,16,400,ASH,"Pikachu, you're the best. "
10,16,401,PIKACHU,[HAPPY] 
10,16,402,ASH,Oh yeah. 
10,16,403,PAUL,How pathetic. 
10,16,404,NARRATOR,"And so, our Hero's first attempt at a Sinnoh victory ends in his first defeat. The road to a Sinnoh League victory may be a long and rocky one, but we'll be there every step of the way! TO BE CONTINUED.."

10,15,10,ASH,There it is guys! It's Oreburgh City! 
10,15,11,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
10,15,12,DAWN,Sure looks like a great place to have your first Sinnoh Battle. 
10,15,13,ASH,"Also, a great place to get my first badge! What do you say? "
10,15,14,PIKACHU,[AGREEING] 
10,15,15,NARRATOR,Our heroes' arduous trek over an imposingly steep mountain has ended in joyous excitement all around! 
10,15,16,NARRATOR,"Now, with energy to spare, they're headed for the next important stop-the Oreburgh Gym! "
10,15,17,DAWN,Just look at this place! 
10,15,18,DAWN,Sure doesn't look like the kind of Gym you'd challenge unless you were serious about it! 
10,15,19,ASH,"Yeah? Well then, that's for me! "
10,15,20,PIKACHU,[DETERMINED] - 
10,15,21,ASH,"Whoa, it's Paul! - "
10,15,22,PAUL,Do I know you? 
10,15,23,IAN,"Paul, these friends of yours? "
10,15,24,PAUL,No way... 
10,15,25,ASH,You must have just fought a battle. Get a badge? 
10,15,26,PAUL,"Hey, that's none of your business! "
10,15,27,ASH,Paul? 
10,15,28,IAN,I'll bet you're here for a battle too! 
10,15,29,ASH,"Yeah My name's Ash, and I'm from Pallet Town. "
10,15,30,ASH,This will be my first battle in Sinnoh. It's great to be here! 
10,15,31,PIKACHU,[GREETINGS] 
10,15,32,IAN,"Say, that's quite a long trip all the way from Kanto! Welcome to the temple for Rock Pokémon the Oreburgh Gym! "
10,15,33,ASH,You mean this Gym's for Rock Pokémon? - 
10,15,34,PAUL,Duh - 
10,15,35,IAN,You've got it. And our Gym Leader's name is Roark! 
10,15,36,ASH,Wait! Then that means you must not be the Gym Leader! 
10,15,37,IAN,"I take care of the Pokémon here. The name is Ian, and Roark's not here right at the moment. I'm sure you'll be able to have a battle with Roark as soon as Paul is finished with his! "
10,15,38,ASH,"Sounds great, thanks! "
10,15,39,PAUL,"So until Roark gets back, I'll be at the Pokémon Center. "
10,15,40,ASH,"Hey Paul, let's both give it all we've got! "
10,15,41,ASH,What is with that guy...? 
10,15,42,PIKACHU,[UNSURE] 
10,15,43,IAN,Here's your Sinnoh region Badge Case. 
10,15,44,ASH,"Wow, thank you Ian! "
10,15,45,IAN,"Now, if you win eight badges, you can compete in the Sinnoh League. - Good luck, Ash! - "
10,15,46,ASH,Thanks! 
10,15,47,ASH,Hey Ian... Do you mind if I ask where Roark is? - 
10,15,48,IAN,He's coal mining! - 
10,15,49,ASH,Coal mining? 
10,15,50,BROCK,Makes sense to me! That's gotta be where Oreburgh City gets its name. I've heard Oreburgh City has some of the richest coal ore anywhere! 
10,15,51,IAN,"And while Roark digs for coal, he's exploring forhidden treasure! "
10,15,52,ASH,Hidden treasure? 
10,15,53,COAL MINERS,[EXERTION] 
10,15,54,JESSIE,Listen! Is that big money calling from below? 
10,15,55,JAMES,The sound of success tells me so! -

10,15,57,JAMES,Dig deep! 
10,15,58,MEOWTH,Make some dough! 
10,15,59,JESSIE,Sock it away at a breakneck pace! 
10,15,60,JAMES,Putting big bucks in poverty's place! 
10,15,61,JESSIE,"Roses smell sweet, but we prefer coal! "
10,15,62,JAMES,A rose doesn't cut it if money's your goal! - 
10,15,63,JESSIE,Jessie! - 
10,15,64,JAMES,James! 
10,15,65,MEOWTH,Dig! Meowth is the name! 
10,15,66,JESSIE,Tired of being on the dole. 
10,15,67,JAMES,We're Team Rocket! 
10,15,68,JESSIE,And we're on a roll! 
10,15,69,WOBBUFFET,[AGREEMENT] 
10,15,70,JESSIE,"This work-hard-and-fly-right, another-day-another-dollar stuff may work for you, but for me, it stinks! "
10,15,71,WOBBUFFET,[SHOCKED] / [YELLING] 
10,15,72,ASH,Excuse me! 
10,15,73,PIKACHU,[CALLING] - 
10,15,74,JESSIE,Twerps?! - 
10,15,75,ASH,What? 
10,15,76,JAMES,Look at that! It's the erp-tway and all of his little end-frays! 
10,15,77,JESSIE,Gee I wonder what they ant way? 
10,15,78,ASH,We heard that Roark the Oreburgh Gym leader was here. - That true? - 
10,15,79,JESSIE,Roark? 
10,15,80,ASH,[NOTICE] - 
10,15,81,WORKER A,Easy now - 
10,15,82,WORKER B,Don't worry 
10,15,83,ROARK,"Okay, you can leave it right there! "
10,15,84,WORKER A,"Okay, Roark! "
10,15,85,ASH,"Did he say Roark? Then, that's him! "
10,15,86,ROARK,"Welcome, from your century to mine! "
10,15,87,ASH,"Excuse me, Mr. Roark! "
10,15,88,ROARK,Just a moment I'm having a talk with this Fossil right now. - 
10,15,89,ASH,You talk to Fossils? - 
10,15,90,ROARK,"I sure do! And right now, it's telling me all about the good old days. I can still feel its warmth its breath! "
10,15,91,ROARK,"One day, I know you'll come back to life. You can be sure of it. "
10,15,92,ASH,[CONFUSED] 
10,15,93,JESSIE,Back to life? 
10,15,94,ROARK,All right! Let's get it to the museum! 
10,15,95,WORKER A,"Okay, we got it! "
10,15,96,ROARK,What were you saying? 
10,15,97,ASH,I've come to the Oreburgh Gym for a battle! 
10,15,98,DAWN,But someone's ahead of us. 
10,15,99,ROARK,"Well, what do you know? I've got two challengers waiting for me! "
10,15,100,BROCK,"You know, Ian told us when you dig for coal, you're looking for treasure, too. "
10,15,101,ROARK,"Treasure, huh? Of course! - "
10,15,102,ASH,That Fossil! - 
10,15,103,BROCK,Really? 
10,15,104,ROARK,The truth! A lot of Pokémon Fossils turn up while coal mining! 
10,15,105,ROARK,I really enjoy my work as foreman for the miners. 
10,15,106,ASH,You're the foreman? 
10,15,107,JESSIE,Hello! Sorry for butting in like this. 
10,15,108,JAMES,But did he refer to Fossils coming back to life? 
10,15,109,WORKER B,"Oh yes, Ian was speaking of an incredible machine! It resurrects ancient Pokémon Fossils, and it's just great! "
10,15,110,JESSIE,Great! 
10,15,111,JESSIE,Stealing that machine's what I'm talking about! 
10,15,112,JAMES,It is right up our evil alley! 
10,15,113,MEOWTH,And no more dough digging! 
10,15,114,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,15,115,IAN,"Welcome back, Roark! How was the treasure hunt? "
10,15,116,ROARK,We've really discovered something this time! This may just be the best fossil yet! 
10,15,117,IAN,"Oh, there's Paul. He's your first challenger! "
10,15,118,ROARK,[NOTICE] 
10,15,119,ROARK,I'm sorry to keep you waiting! 'm Roark the Gym leader. Nice to meet you! 
10,15,120,PAUL,The same here. 
10,15,121,ROARK,"So, why don't we get started then? "
10,15,122,DAWN,Can't wait to see a Gym battle! 
10,15,123,ASH,[SURPRISE] 
10,15,124,ROARK,You've never seen one? 
10,15,125,DAWN,"No, and I want to learn everything about them I can! "
10,15,126,ROARK,"Well then, it's fine with me. Hey, Paul, how about you? "
10,15,127,PAUL,No prob. I really couldn't care less. 
10,15,128,ASH,You can be sure I'll be watching you guys battle! 
10,15,129,PIKACHU,[ANGRY] 
10,15,130,DAWN,"Awesome! So, this is what it's like in a Gym! "
10,15,131,BROCK,"When it comes to battlefields there are all sorts of different types! Now of course, this Gym is a Rock-type Gym so it's set up to battle with Rock-type Pokémon in mind. "
10,15,132,IAN,"The Oreburgh City Gym battle between Paul, the challenger, and Roark, the Gym leader, is about to get underway! "
10,15,133,IAN,"The battle will be three-on-three, and as soon as all three Pokémon on either side are unable to continue, the challenge is over! In addition, only the challenger may substitute Pokémon! "
10,15,134,IAN,"Now, let the battle begin! "
10,15,135,ROARK,"Geodude, let's go! "
10,15,136,GEODUDE,[APPEARING] 
10,15,137,DAWN,"Oh, wow, it's a Geodude! "
10,15,138,POKEDEX,"Geodude. The Rock Pokémon. Geodude is often found on mountain roads with half of its body buried in the ground, so it can observe mountain travelers. "
10,15,139,PAUL,"Azumarill, stand by! "
10,15,140,AZUMARILL,[APPEARING] 
10,15,141,ASH,"Wow, so Paul's using a Water-type Pokémon! "
10,15,142,POKEDEX,"Azumarill, the Aqua Rabbit Pokémon. Azumarill lives in rivers and lakes, and while in water its body's color and pattern confuses its enemies. "
10,15,143,BROCK,"Since Water-type moves are really powerful against Rock-type Pokémon, Azumarill's a smart choice. "
10,15,144,DAWN,"Then Paul's got the upper hand, right? "
10,15,145,BROCK,I guess. In theory anyway. 
10,15,146,DAWN,Theory? 
10,15,147,ROARK,Paul! You have the honor! 
10,15,148,PAUL,"Azumarill! Hydro Pump, go! "
10,15,149,AZUMARILL,[HYDRO PUMP MOVE] 
10,15,150,ROARK,Geodude! Hidden Power! 
10,15,151,GEODUDE,[GRUNT] / [EXERTION] 
10,15,152,AZUMARILL,[GRUNT] 
10,15,153,ASH,It b*at back that Hydro Pump! 
10,15,154,BROCK,"And that was a Water-type move, too! "
10,15,155,ROARK,"All right, Geodude, Rollout! "
10,15,156,GEODUDE,[ROLLOUT MOVE] 
10,15,157,PAUL,"Water g*n, Azumarill! "
10,15,158,AZUMARILL,[WATER g*n MOVE] 
10,15,159,AZUMARILL,[GRUNT] 
10,15,160,BROCK,Not giving his challengers any time for counter att*cks is how Roark keeps up the pressure! 
10,15,161,GEODUDE,[ROLLOUT MOVE] 
10,15,162,AZUMARILL,[GRUNT] 
10,15,163,PAUL,What? 
10,15,164,AZUMARILL,[STUNNED] 
10,15,165,IAN,Azumarill is unable to battle! Geodude wins! 
10,15,166,DAWN,A Water-type Pokémon just lost to a Rock type! 
10,15,167,BROCK,"Every time Geodude's Rollout hits it just keeps getting stronger But even so, getting a knockout on just the second att*ck? "
10,15,168,DAWN,Now I understand what you meant before when you said Paul's upper hand was in theory. - 
10,15,169,PAUL,Good-for-nothing! - 
10,15,170,ASH,The creep! 
10,15,171,PIKACHU,[ANGRY] 
10,15,172,PAUL,"Now, Elekid, stand by! "
10,15,173,ELEKID,[APPEARING] 
10,15,174,ROARK,"I'm sure Paul knows full well that Geodude is a Ground type, and also that Elekid's Electric-type moves won't work very well at all. So I wonder what he's got up his sleeve... "
10,15,175,PAUL,"Now, Elekid, Brick Break! "
10,15,176,ELEKID,[BRICK BREAK MOVE] 
10,15,177,ROARK,Clever. They're using a Fighting-type move! But we're still going to stick with using Rollout! 
10,15,178,GEODUDE,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,15,179,ELEKID,[BRICK BREAK MOVE] 
10,15,180,GEODUDE,[GROAN] 
10,15,181,IAN,Geodude is unable to battle! Elekid wins! 
10,15,182,ROARK,And they did it with just one hit? 
10,15,183,DAWN,But how? I thought Elekid was at a huge disadvantage. 
10,15,184,BROCK,See? That goes to show that you can overcome just about any disadvantage by using the right moves. 
10,15,185,ROARK,"Geodude, return! Thanks a lot, good friend. "
10,15,186,ELEKID,[PUMPED] 
10,15,187,ROARK,"Onix, you're up next! "
10,15,188,ONIX,[ROAR] 
10,15,189,ASH,He's going to use Onix! 
10,15,190,DAWN,It's huge! 
10,15,191,POKEDEX,"Onix. The Rock Snake Pokémon. It tunnels through the ground, which shakes when it raises its thunderous roar. "
10,15,192,POKEDEX,It can move through the ground at  miles per hour. - 
10,15,193,BROCK,This Onix can do it! - 
10,15,194,DAWN,How do you know? 
10,15,195,BROCK,"Because I raised one myself, and I can tell just by looking at it that this Onix has already been through some very tough battles! "
10,15,196,PAUL,I'll be staying with my Elekid. 
10,15,197,ROARK,"Fine! Since I've already seen your Brick Break, I wonder how well you'll do now! "
10,15,198,PAUL,"Quick, Elekid, use Brick Break! "
10,15,199,ELEKID,[CHARGE] 
10,15,200,ROARK,Dodge Onix! 
10,15,201,ONIX,[EXERTION] 
10,15,202,ELEKID,[MISS] 
10,15,203,PIKACHU,[GASP] 
10,15,204,ASH,That's fast! 
10,15,205,DAWN,How can something so big move so quickly? 
10,15,206,ROARK,"Now use Slam, Onix! "
10,15,207,ONIX,[ROAR] 
10,15,208,ELEKID,[GASP] 
10,15,209,ONIX,[CHARGE] 
10,15,210,PAUL,Protect! 
10,15,211,ELEKID,[PROTECT MOVE] 
10,15,212,ELEKID,[BRACE] 
10,15,213,ONIX,[ROAR] 
10,15,214,ROARK,"Double-Edge, let's go! "
10,15,215,ONIX,[DOUBLE-EDGE MOVE] 
10,15,216,ELEKID,[FALL] 
10,15,217,DAWN,"Wow, Onix caught Elekid right when its protective barrier went down! "
10,15,218,ASH,"Yeah, Dawn, you're right, but Onix got hurt when itcounterattacked with that Double-Edge! "
10,15,219,ONIX,[GROWL] 
10,15,220,DAWN,But Onix looks just fine to me! 
10,15,221,BROCK,"That's cause Onix can use Rock Head. Rock Head's a special Ability: It takes moves that would normally cause recoil damage, and completely prevents it from ever taking place! - "
10,15,222,DAWN,Wow - 
10,15,223,PAUL,"Stay strong, or else! "
10,15,224,ELEKID,[WINCING] 
10,15,225,ROARK,"Stealth Rock, go! "
10,15,226,ONIX,[STEALTH ROCK MOVE] 
10,15,227,ELEKID,[GASP] - 
10,15,228,ASH,"Elekid, look out! - "
10,15,229,ROARK,"Stealth Rock, go! "
10,15,230,ONIX,[STEALTH ROCK MOVE] 
10,15,231,ELEKID,[GASP] 
10,15,232,ASH,"Elekid, look out! "
10,15,233,ELEKID,[BRACING] 
10,15,234,PAUL,Did he say Stealth Rock? 
10,15,235,ASH,What kind of move is that? 
10,15,236,PIKACHU,[AWE] 
10,15,237,BROCK,Stealth Rock causes damage to Pokémon that appear later in the battle. It has no affect at all on the Pokémon currently out there! 
10,15,238,DAWN,"You mean if Paul decides to call Elekid back and chooseanother Pokémon, then that Pokémon will take all the damage? "
10,15,239,BROCK,"Right! It looks like Roark is taking care of Paul's substitutions before they happen, making things that much trickier for Paul! "
10,15,240,ELEKID,[GROWL] 
10,15,241,ROARK,"If you were going to exchange Pokémon, you should have done it earlier! "
10,15,242,ROARK,"Slam, Onix, let's go! "
10,15,243,ONIX,[ROAR] 
10,15,244,ONIX,[SLAM MOVE][GRUNT] 
10,15,245,ONIX,[PARALYZED] 
10,15,246,ROARK,Uh oh 
10,15,247,DAWN,Hey what's wrong with Onix? 
10,15,248,BROCK,It's called Static a special Ability of Elekid's! 
10,15,249,DAWN,How does it work? 
10,15,250,BROCK,"When Elekid made physical contact, Onix became paralyzed! "
10,15,251,PAUL,"Brick Break, Elekid, now! "
10,15,252,ELEKID,[SPRING INTO ACTION] 
10,15,253,ROARK,"Double-Edge, Onix! "
10,15,254,ONIX,[ROAR] 
10,15,255,ONIX,[CONNECT] 
10,15,256,PIKACHU,[SHOCK] 
10,15,257,ELEKID,[WINCING] 
10,15,258,ONIX,[GRUNT] 
10,15,259,ROARK,Don't get too comfortable with Static! Sometimes moves can be used even when paralyzed! 
10,15,260,ELEKID,[STRUGGLING] 
10,15,261,ROARK,I'm impressed! Elekid's a resilient Pokémon! 
10,15,262,PAUL,"Now, Elekid, return! "
10,15,263,DAWN,"Wow, what's Paul doing? "
10,15,264,BROCK,I guess he doesn't really care about the Stealth Rock! 
10,15,265,ASH,Yeah he doesn't care if his next Pokémon get hurt or not! 
10,15,266,PAUL,"Now, Chimchar stand by! "
10,15,267,CHIMCHAR,[CHEERFUL] 
10,15,268,CHIMCHAR,[NOTICE] 
10,15,269,CHIMCHAR,[BREAK FREE] [HEAVY BREATHING] 
10,15,270,ROARK,A Fire type next eh? Impressive the way you come at me with Pokémon that aren't considered very good matchups! 
10,15,271,PAUL,Chimchar use Dig! 
10,15,272,CHIMCHAR,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,15,273,ONIX,[NOTICING] 
10,15,274,ROARK,Try to sense where Chimchar's moving Onix! 
10,15,275,ONIX,[GRUNT] 
10,15,276,CHIMCHAR,[DIG MOVE] 
10,15,277,ONIX,[SHOCKED] 
10,15,278,DAWN,Making a huge Onix jump like that is no small feat! 
10,15,279,BROCK,Using Dig should have a powerful effect on Onix as well! 
10,15,280,ASH,So that's why Paul had Chimchar learn Dig! Awesome strategy! 
10,15,281,ROARK,"Now, use Double-Edge! "
10,15,282,ONIX,[DOUBLE-EDGE MOVE] 
10,15,283,PAUL,Chimchar use Dig one more time! 
10,15,284,CHIMCHAR,[DIG MOVE] 
10,15,285,ROARK,"Onix, stand still! Just feel Chimchar's movements! "
10,15,286,ONIX,[WINCE] 
10,15,287,ROARK,When will that Static wear off? 
10,15,288,PAUL,Chimchar! Do it! 
10,15,289,CHIMCHAR,[APPEARING] 
10,15,290,ONIX,[SHOCK] 
10,15,291,ONIX,[FAINTING] 
10,15,292,IAN,Onix is unable to battle! Chimchar wins! 
10,15,293,CHIMCHAR,[PANTING] - 
10,15,294,PAUL,"Not bad, Chimchar - "
10,15,295,ROARK,"Onix, return! "
10,15,296,ROARK,You were great. Take a nice long rest! 
10,15,297,ROARK,"Well, Paul, you're giving me quite a run for my money! It's time to bring out my final Pokémon! I suggest you get ready. "
10,15,298,ROARK,"Cranidos, let's go! "
10,15,299,CRANIDOS,[APPEARING] 
10,15,300,ASH,Cranidos looks just like that Fossil! 
10,15,301,PIKACHU,[AWE] 
10,15,302,POKEDEX,"Cranidos. The Headbutt Pokémon. Cranidos lived in the deep woods about one hundred million years ago, and its cranium is as hard as steel! "
10,15,303,PAUL,"Roark, I can read you like a book! Chimchar, use Dig! "
10,15,304,CHIMCHAR,[DIG MOVE] 
10,15,305,ROARK,Cranidos! Headbutt now! 
10,15,306,CRANIDOS,[FOCUS] 
10,15,307,CHIMCHAR ,[DIGGING] 
10,15,308,CHIMCHAR,[DIG MOVE] 
10,15,309,CRANIDOS,[HEADBUTT MOVE] 
10,15,310,CHIMCHAR,[SCREAM] 
10,15,311,ASH,What a hit! 
10,15,312,BROCK,Cranidos's anticipating Chimchar's movements! 
10,15,313,PAUL,"Chimchar, use Dig one more time! "
10,15,314,CHIMCHAR,[DIG MOVE] 
10,15,315,ROARK,"Cranidos, Zen Headbutt! "
10,15,316,CRANIDOS,[ZEN HEADBUTT] 
10,15,317,CHIMCHAR,[GROAN] 
10,15,318,ASH,"Hey, that's a much stronger move than Headbutt! "
10,15,319,BROCK,There's no doubt that Zen Headbutt's got a lot more power than a normal Headbutt. I've heard it can scare an opponent into flinching! 
10,15,320,ROARK,"Zen Headbutt, again! "
10,15,321,CRANIDOS,[ZEN HEADBUTT MOVE] 
10,15,322,PAUL,"Quick, Chimchar, use Dig! "
10,15,323,CHIMCHAR,[NERVOUS] 
10,15,324,BROCK,"Amazing! Chimchar's so scared, it doesn't hear anything that Paul says! "
10,15,325,CHIMCHAR,[YELL] 
10,15,326,CRANIDOS,[HIT] 
10,15,327,CHIMCHAR,[YELL] 
10,15,328,CRANIDOS,[att*ck] - 
10,15,329,PAUL,Come on! - 
10,15,330,ROARK,Focus Energy! 
10,15,331,CRANIDOS,[FOCUS ENERGY MOVE] 
10,15,332,DAWN,What's going on now Brock? 
10,15,333,BROCK,Focus Energy focuses your att*ck strength and makes it easier to hit a weak spot. I think Roark's planning to use one sh*t to knock out Chimchar! 
10,15,334,ASH,You got to get Chimchar out of there! 
10,15,335,CHIMCHAR,[EXCITED] 
10,15,336,PAUL,I was waiting for this! 
10,15,337,ASH,For what? 
10,15,338,PIKACHU,[WONDERING] 
10,15,339,BROCK,Chimchar's using Blaze. Watch out! 
10,15,340,BROCK,Blaze's a special Ability that makes Chimchar's Fire-type moves much stronger when its endurance is low! But I'm not sure how much of an effect it'll have on a Rock type like Cranidos... 
10,15,341,CHIMCHAR,[CHEER] 
10,15,342,ROARK,"Zen Headbutt, again! "
10,15,343,CRANIDOS,[CHARGING] 
10,15,344,PAUL,"Now, Flame Wheel! "
10,15,345,CHIMCHAR,[FLAME WHEEL MOVE] - 
10,15,346,ASH,That's fast! - 
10,15,347,PAUL,Aim for the legs! 
10,15,348,CRANIDOS,[YELLING] 
10,15,349,CRANIDOS,[GROAN] 
10,15,350,ASH,That Flame Wheel's strong! 
10,15,351,BROCK,"Chimchar's Flame Wheel was so juiced up with Blaze, it was faster than Cranidos was! "
10,15,352,CRANIDOS,[STRUGGLING] 
10,15,353,CHIMCHAR,[LANDING] 
10,15,354,PAUL,"Flame Wheel, Chimchar, once more! "

10,15,357,ASH,[SHOCK]

10,15,359,CHIMCHAR,[DIG MOVE] 
10,15,360,ROARK,"Cranidos, Focus Energy, now! "
10,15,361,CRANIDOS,[FOCUS ENERGY MOVE] 
10,15,362,CHIMCHAR,[att*ck] 
10,15,363,CRANIDOS,[GROAN] 
10,15,364,ROARK,Use Headbutt! 
10,15,365,CRANIDOS,[HEADBUTT MOVE] 
10,15,366,PAUL,Dodge it quick! 
10,15,367,CHIMCHAR,[GASP] 
10,15,368,CHIMCHAR,[FAINT] 
10,15,369,IAN,Chimchar is unable to battle! Cranidos wins! 
10,15,370,ROARK,Cranidos! How do you feel? 
10,15,371,CRANIDOS,[REASSURING] 
10,15,372,PAUL,"Chimchar, I'll deal with you later! "
10,15,373,PAUL,"Elekid, stand by! "
10,15,374,ELEKID,[APPEARING] 
10,15,375,DAWN,That was Stealth Rock again? 
10,15,376,BROCK,"Yup! Once you use it, the effects just keep going. "
10,15,377,ELEKID,[OUT OF BREATH] 
10,15,378,PAUL,"Now, use Brick Break! "
10,15,379,ELEKID,[RUN] 
10,15,380,ROARK,Flame thrower! 
10,15,381,CRANIDOS,[FLAMETHROWER MOVE] 
10,15,382,ELEKID,[BRICK BREAK MOVE] 
10,15,383,CRANIDOS,[YELL] - 
10,15,384,DAWN,What's that? - 
10,15,385,ASH,Maybe it was Static. 
10,15,386,CRANIDOS,[SHAKING OFF] 
10,15,387,ASH,What a hit! 
10,15,388,PIKACHU,[SHOCK] 
10,15,389,ROARK,"You've just witnessed Cranidos' special Ability, Mold Breaker, ruining your special Ability! "
10,15,390,CRANIDOS,[WINCE] 
10,15,391,ASH,[SHOCK] 
10,15,392,ROARK,Use Zen Headbutt now! 
10,15,393,CRANIDOS,[ZEN HEADBUTT NOW] 
10,15,394,CRANIDOS,[PUSH THROUGH] 
10,15,395,ASH,Cranidos is just moving too slow right now! 
10,15,396,BROCK,Guess that leg injury was worse than I thought! 
10,15,397,PAUL,"Brick Break, one more time! "
10,15,398,ELEKID,[BRICK BREAK MOVE] 
10,15,399,CRANIDOS,[WINCE] 
10,15,400,PAUL,"No more Headbutt, huh? "
10,15,401,ROARK,"I see, you don't rely on moves or types for your strategy, you just use what att*ck style is best for the moment! "
10,15,402,DAWN,Cranidos' att*ck power seems to be totally dependent on the strength of its legs... 
10,15,403,BROCK,"Paul sure looked to me like he was waiting for Chimchar's Blaze to take effect, which could explain the way he uses Pokémon. "
10,15,404,ASH,Of course! That's why he taught Chimchar to battle like that! 
10,15,405,PAUL,Brick Break let's go! 
10,15,406,ELEKID,[YELLING]

10,15,433,ROARK,Thanks Cranidos! Enjoy a nice long rest! 
10,15,434,ROARK,"That was some impressive battling, Paul! "
10,15,435,ROARK,And here's your Oreburgh Gym badge! Congratulations Paul! 
10,15,436,PAUL,Thank you very much Roark. I'll see you. 
10,15,437,ASH,Where you going? 
10,15,438,ASH,Aren't you gonna stay to watch my battle?

10,14,32,DAWN,Aw.But there's a Pokémon Center right there!

10,14,34,ASH,What do you mean? 
10,14,35,ASH,That Oreburgh Gym's been waiting for me for a long time now!

10,14,57,ASH,What's going on? 
10,14,58,NUZLEAF,[att*ck] 
10,14,59,DAWN,Who's that Pokémon? 
10,14,60,POKEDEX,"Nuzleaf. The Wily Pokémon. Nuzleaf lives in dense, overgrown forests, and occasionally comes out to frighten people. "
10,14,61,BROCK,I know Nuzleaf like to live in groups. 
10,14,62,DAWN,How Brock does that's beyond me! 
10,14,63,NURSE JOY,"This Nuzleaf's injured, and I was trying to do what I could to help! "
10,14,64,NURSE JOY,Unless we do something. 
10,14,65,BROCK,This Nuzleaf will always be afraid of people! Let me see what I can do. 
10,14,66,NUZLEAF,[DEFENSIVE] 
10,14,67,BROCK,It's okay! 
10,14,68,BROCK,"When you approach a Pokémon that's feeling threatened, you open your heart, then hide your hands to show you mean no harm and crouch until you're at eye-level with it! That will relax it. "
10,14,69,NUZLEAF,[CONFUSED]

10,14,102,ROCK,What do you mean? 
10,14,103,NURSE JOY,Just on the other side of this mountain grows a thousand-year-old tree... 
10,14,104,NURSE JOY,There's a group of Seedot and its evolved forms. Nuzleaf and Shiftry. Living in it and that's the only place you'll find any Nuzleaf within a hundred miles of here! 
10,14,105,BROCK,"Well, there's gotta be a reason this Nuzleaf got separated from its friends. "
10,14,106,ASH,"Hey, let's get Nuzleaf back to the tree! "
10,14,107,DAWN,Yeah! Sounds great!

10,14,111,BROCK,Count on it! 
10,14,112,NURSE JOY,Well that's awfully sweet of you Brock! 
10,14,113,JESSIE,Nuzleaf are nice. 
10,14,114,MEOWTH,"Nuzleaf are trickier then nice, but the Boss would still love it! "
10,14,115,JAMES,Sounds like a match made in heaven to me. 
10,14,116,MEOWTH,"Imagine the Boss, home from the office trying to chill after a hard day's work. "
10,14,117,MEOWTH,The majesty of a beautiful sunset makes him take stock of his life to this point! 
10,14,118,MEOWTH,"You know, I got more money than anyone I know, but still it ain't enough... "
10,14,119,MEOWTH,When suddenly the sweet sound of a leaf whistle breaks the silence! 
10,14,120,MEOWTH,Huh? 
10,14,121,MEOWTH,"You know, this Nuzleaf Meowth and friends gave me shows me what it's all about! Money don't buy me happiness, so I'm giving mine to them! "
10,14,122,MEOWTH,And that's some dough!

10,14,129,DAWN,When Bonsly's really a Rock type! 
10,14,130,MEOWTH,Shiftry! 
10,14,131,ASH,"Wow, a Shiftry! "
10,14,132,DAWN,Maybe Shiftry is one of Nuzleaf's friends! 
10,14,133,JESSIE,"There you are, you shifty Shiftry! "
10,14,134,DAWN,Who are you guys? 
10,14,135,JAMES,"Oh, just your typical mountain climbers! "
10,14,136,JESSIE,I'm a girl though!

10,14,138,JESSIE,Day after day. Rain or shine.  years nonstop! Shiftry's never given up hope this day would come! 
10,14,139,ASH,You saying this Nuzleaf's been lost for  years?

10,14,144,JAMES,"It just said, ""Get over here Nuzleaf pal!"" "
10,14,145,DAWN,That's a Shiftry huh? 
10,14,146,POKEDEX,Meowth. The Scratch Cat Pokémon. When it sees round objects it plays and loses track of time.

10,13,51,DAWN,But I hope us being here isn't getting in your way.

10,13,75,ROSEBAY,"I'm working hard trying to find out why, but this forest is a big place! "

10,13,361,JESSIE,It almost makes you forget what's coming up next! 
10,13,362,JESSIE,We're blasting off again! 
10,13,363,WOBBUFFET,[ANNOYED] 
10,13,364,ASH,"Starly, you were awesome! "

10,12,5,ASH,Awesome! 
10,12,6,PIKACHU,[HAPPY] 
10,12,7,AIPOM,[EXCITED] 
10,12,8,BROCK,Nothing like getting past that first step! - 
10,12,9,DAWN,What a relief! - 
10,12,10,ZOEY,Congrats! 
10,12,11,DAWN,"Thanks, Zoey! But you made it all look easy! I can see why you already have a ribbon. "
10,12,12,ZOEY,"Well, I don't know about that. "
10,12,13,DAWN,Oh no! 
10,12,14,ZOEY,[CONFUSED] 
10,12,15,DAWN,I've gotta call my mom right now! 
10,12,16,JOHANNA,Of course I was watching! 
10,12,17,JOHANNA,Congratulations on getting to Round Two. 
10,12,18,DAWN,"Thanks, Mom! "
10,12,19,JOHANNA,"Remember, this is a whole new ball game. "
10,12,20,JOHANNA,"It's a battle, after all.though you still have to make your Pokémon look their best! "
10,12,21,DAWN,"Mom, I know. Don't worry! "
10,12,22,JOHANNA,There's that phrase. 
10,12,23,JOHANNA,"So! You'd better get a move on, since you don't havemuch time left. "
10,12,24,DAWN,"Call you later. Bye, Mom! "
10,12,25,MARIAN,"Okay, ladies and gentlemen, time for our second round, and here's the battle board! "
10,12,26,MARIAN,"So, let's give the board a random shuffle and see our matchups. And there they are! "
10,12,27,ASH,"Well, what do you know.me and Zoey! "
10,12,28,PIKACHU,[DETERMINED]

10,12,30,ASH,"Thanks! All right, time to start a winning streak! First the Jubilife Ribbon, and then we'll get the Oreburgh badge! "
10,12,31,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
10,12,32,DAWN,"Ash, slow down. An appeal battle is different from a Gym battle! "
10,12,33,ASH,"Hey, we can handle any battle you throw at us! Zoey,I'll see you out there! "
10,12,34,ZOEY,Hold on. Are you saying you're going to compete in the Sinnoh League? 
10,12,35,ASH,Yeah! That's what I came here for in the first place! 
10,12,36,ZOEY,"Well then, what are you doing competing in contests for? "
10,12,37,ZOEY,You obviously can't tell the difference between contests and Gyms. I'd remember that if I were you! 
10,12,38,DAWN,What was that? 
10,12,39,ASH,"Who cares? Hey, I'll just battle the way I know how! "
10,12,40,ASH,Rock and roll! 
10,12,41,AIPOM,[GIGGLING] 
10,12,42,JESSIE,"Ha! Clueless Twerps. There's only one winner, and that's me! "
10,12,43,JAMES,"Oh, Jessie. "
10,12,44,JAMES,Bad news. 
10,12,45,MEOWTH,We're the end result of mob rule! 
10,12,46,JESSIE,Mob? Looks like you had a fight with a truck! 
10,12,47,JESSIE,So why didn't you yahoos get out of there while the getting was good? - 
10,12,48,JAMES,Good salesmanship? - 
10,12,49,JESSIE,Okay.what about sales? 
10,12,50,JAMES,We sold gobs. 
10,12,51,MEOWTH,Then they gave 'em back with a knuckle sandwich. 
10,12,52,JESSIE,"Well, no surprise there. Hey, chin up! As long as I win this, we'll be just fine! "
10,12,53,MEOWTH,"Wait, you're saying you made it to Round Two? "
10,12,54,JESSIE,What did you think? This is Jessilina we're talking about! - 
10,12,55,JAMES,Whoa! - 
10,12,56,MEOWTH,Impressive effect! 
10,12,57,JESSIE,That ribbon is for me and me only. 
10,12,58,JESSIE,"And soon, I'll rule the contest world and take over the galaxy! "
10,12,59,WOBBUFFET,[DISGRUNTLED] 
10,12,60,MARIAN,This is it.the moment you've all been waiting for! 
10,12,61,MARIAN,Get ready for the second-round battles! 
10,12,62,MARIAN,The Coordinator who can show off their most beautiful moves and strip away the most points from their opponent in five minutes wins! 
10,12,63,MARIAN,So let's get started with our first matchup! 
10,12,64,MARIAN,It's Ash in one corner. 
10,12,65,MARIAN,And it's Zoey in the other! 
10,12,66,MARIAN,We've got a five-minute time limit on the clock. 
10,12,67,MARIAN,And we're off! 
10,12,68,ASH,"All right. Aipom, I choose you! "
10,12,69,AIPOM,[APPEARING] 
10,12,70,AIPOM,[EXCITED] 
10,12,71,ZOEY,"All right, Glameow.curtain! "
10,12,72,GLAMEOW,[APPEARING] 
10,12,73,GLAMEOW,[PURRING] 
10,12,74,ASH,Aipom! Go get 'em! 
10,12,75,AIPOM,[FOCUSED] 
10,12,76,MARIAN,And Ash makes the first move! 
10,12,77,ZOEY,"Stay, Glameow. "
10,12,78,GLAMEOW,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,12,79,GLAMEOW,[CASUAL] 
10,12,80,DAWN,Why won't Glameow move? 
10,12,81,BROCK,She's got something up her sleeve. 
10,12,82,ASH,"You wanna lay back, fine with me! Aipom, use Focus Punch! "
10,12,83,AIPOM,[FOCUS PUNCH MOVE] 
10,12,84,MARIAN,And Aipom descends from above with a Focus Punch! 
10,12,85,ZOEY,Grab Aipom! 
10,12,86,GLAMEOW,[EFFORT] 
10,12,87,GLAMEOW,[CHALLENGING] 
10,12,88,ASH,Oh no! 
10,12,89,AIPOM,[SHOCKED] 
10,12,90,MARIAN,"Surprise, surprise. "
10,12,91,MARIAN,"With a quick flick of the tail, Glameow's stopped that Focus Punch cold! "
10,12,92,DAWN,Glameow's so fast! 
10,12,93,BROCK,"That was some strategy. not moving until the right time and then, look out! "
10,12,94,PIKACHU,[IMPRESSED] 
10,12,95,ZOEY,"Nice work, Glameow! Now give Aipom a toss! "
10,12,96,GLAMEOW,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,12,97,AIPOM,[EFFORT] 
10,12,98,AIPOM,[SCARED] 
10,12,99,ASH,"Aipom, snap out of it and use Swift! "
10,12,100,AIPOM,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,12,101,AIPOM,[SWIFT MOVE] 
10,12,102,GLAMEOW,[PAINED] 
10,12,103,ZOEY,Glameow! 
10,12,104,MARIAN,Aipom's not through just yet! 
10,12,105,MARIAN,"Even in the middle of being thrown, Aipom rustles up a huge Swift! "
10,12,106,ASH,"Great, Aipom! "
10,12,107,AIPOM,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,12,108,ZOEY,"Glameow! Fury Swipes, let's go! "
10,12,109,GLAMEOW,[FURY SWIPES MOVE] 
10,12,110,ASH,"Aipom, Double Team! "
10,12,111,AIPOM,[DOUBLE TEAM MOVE] 
10,12,112,GLAMEOW,[CONFUSED] 
10,12,113,AIPOM,[CHALLENGING] 
10,12,114,ASH,Aipom! Let's give 'em Swift once again! 
10,12,115,AIPOM,[SWIFT MOVE] 
10,12,116,ZOEY,Dodge and use Fury Swipes! 
10,12,117,GLAMEOW,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,12,118,GLAMEOW,[FURY SWIPES MOVE] 
10,12,119,AIPOM,[SHOCKED] - 
10,12,120,ASH,"Aipom, no! - "
10,12,121,MARIAN,Glameow looks great! 
10,12,122,MARIAN,Using Aipom's att*ck for a counterattack has tons of appeal! 
10,12,123,GLAMEOW,[TAUNTING] 
10,12,124,AIPOM,[IMPACT] 
10,12,125,DAWN,How did Glameow get through Aipom's att*ck? 
10,12,126,BROCK,"Not only did that show off Glameow's power, it showed how clever Zoey is as well! "
10,12,127,JAMES,Looks like the Twerp's up to his cap in calamity. 
10,12,128,MEOWTH,I guess contests aren't just another day at the Gym. 
10,12,129,JESSIE,Of course they aren't! It takes finesse. Something a member of the male persuasion doesn't have. 
10,12,130,ASH,"Don't give up! Aipom, Focus Punch! "
10,12,131,AIPOM,[FOCUS PUNCH MOVE] 
10,12,132,ZOEY,"Glameow! Iron Tail, let's go! "
10,12,133,GLAMEOW,[AFFIRMATIVE]

10,12,139,GLAMEOW,[IRON TAIL MOVE] 
10,12,140,AIPOM,[IMPACT] 
10,12,141,ASH,Aipom! 
10,12,142,MARIAN,Somehow Glameow managed to use Iron Tail while at the same time straightening its tail for a soul-rattling hit! 
10,12,143,AIPOM,[PAINED] 
10,12,144,MARIAN,"Well, we've just passed the -second mark, and at this point Zoey has a huge advantage! "
10,12,145,ASH,"Yeah, so? "
10,12,146,ASH,Aipom! We just can't let 'em b*at us like this! 
10,12,147,AIPOM,[DETERMINED] 
10,12,148,ASH,"Now, Focus Punch! "
10,12,149,AIPOM,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,12,150,MARIAN,Guess Ash isn't about to give up yet! 
10,12,151,MARIAN,And Aipom sets its sights on Glameow with a Focus Punch! 
10,12,152,ZOEY,Get ready to use Shadow Claw! 
10,12,153,GLAMEOW,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,12,154,ASH,"Shadow Claw? All right, now's our chance! "
10,12,155,DAWN,Hold on. That's a Ghost-type move! That won't work on a normal type like Aipom! 
10,12,156,BROCK,I don't think it's the hit that Zoey's going for. 
10,12,157,DAWN,[SURPRISED] 
10,12,158,AIPOM,[FOCUS PUNCH MOVE] 
10,12,159,GLAMEOW,[SHADOW CLAW MOVE] 
10,12,160,AIPOM,[IMPACT] 
10,12,161,MARIAN,"And both att*cks smash into each other, but it looks like the Focus Punch is getting through! "
10,12,162,ASH,Let's go! 
10,12,163,AIPOM,[FEROCIOUS] 
10,12,164,ZOEY,"Jump, Glameow! "
10,12,165,GLAMEOW,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,12,166,ASH,[SHOCKED] 
10,12,167,MARIAN,"And Glameow's out of there and quick, leaving Aipom in a daze! "
10,12,168,BROCK,[SHOCKED] 
10,12,169,MARIAN,That Shadow Claw was just a bluff! 
10,12,170,ZOEY,"Now, Glameow! Iron Tail! "
10,12,171,GLAMEOW,[IRON TAIL MOVE] 
10,12,172,AIPOM,[IMPACT] 
10,12,173,MARIAN,And Glameow's Iron Tail makes a super-clean hit! 
10,12,174,AIPOM,[WEAK] 
10,12,175,MARIAN,We're down to the wire here. 
10,12,176,MARIAN,Has the end result been decided? 
10,12,177,ASH,Not if I can help it! 
10,12,178,ASH,"Aipom! Use Focus Punch, max power! "
10,12,179,AIPOM,[FOCUS PUNCH MOVE] 
10,12,180,MARIAN,Talk about determined! 
10,12,181,MARIAN,This is a battle to the finish! 
10,12,182,MARIAN,Will Ash and Aipom somehow create a miracle turnaround? 
10,12,183,MARIAN,That's it! Time's up! 
10,12,184,MARIAN,And the winner of this awesome high-tension battle is. Zoey! 
10,12,185,CONTESTA,"Well, that was impressive! To use a move that would normally be ineffective in such a way was just striking! "
10,12,186,SUKIZO,Yes.remarkable as well! 
10,12,187,NURSE JOY,I forgot I was watching a contest! 
10,12,188,ASH,"You worked really hard, Aipom. Thanks for being so great! "
10,12,189,AIPOM,[PLEASED] 
10,12,190,DAWN,That was one of the most exciting battles I've ever seen! My heart was b*ating so fast! 
10,12,191,BROCK,"Yeah, but if you ask me, uh. Don't you think things got a little wild? "
10,12,192,AIPOM,[EATING] 
10,12,193,ASH,"Yeah, guess you're right. I totally forgot about making sure my moves were all looking good. "
10,12,194,DAWN,"Hi, Zoey! "
10,12,195,ASH,Congratulations on your win. And good luck with your next round! 
10,12,196,ZOEY,"That last Focus Punch... It was so powerful, I froze in my tracks! "
10,12,197,ASH,Yeah? I guess I was just concentrating so hard. 
10,12,198,ZOEY,If time hadn't run out when it did. I'm sure you would've beaten me. 
10,12,199,ZOEY,Thanks for a great battle! 
10,12,200,ZOEY,"Still, if you don't mind me saying, I don't think a Contest Battle is where you shine. "
10,12,201,ASH,Yeah! I guess I had to try it. But I know you're right! 
10,12,202,AIPOM,[EATING] 
10,12,203,DAWN,"Hey, get this! Ash entered the contest because Aipom wantedto take a sh*t! "
10,12,204,ZOEY,Aipom? 
10,12,205,ASH,"That's the truth, all right. "
10,12,206,AIPOM,[EATING] 
10,12,207,ZOEY,Hmm... 
10,12,208,ZOEY,"I know what to do! Dawn, you raise Aipom! "

10,12,213,DAWN,It's time. - 
10,12,214,ZOEY,Yeah! 
10,12,215,DAWN,I'm just so excited I can hardly stand it! 
10,12,216,DAWN,Of course! Don't you see? This is the first time I get to battle a high-level Coordinator like you? 
10,12,217,ZOEY,Oh. That's sweet of you to say. 
10,12,218,ZOEY,So! The last thing I want to do is let you down!

10,12,237,GLAMEOW,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,12,238,ASH,Shadow Claw again? 
10,12,239,DAWN,But you know Buneary's a normal type. 
10,12,240,ZOEY,That's true. But sometimes being indirect works. 
10,12,241,ZOEY,Like now! 
10,12,242,GLAMEOW,[SHADOW CLAW MOVE] 
10,12,243,MARIAN,Awesome! Glameow's Shadow Claw just grabbed the Ice Beam!

10,10,39,SHOP WORKER,A representative from the Pokétch company just came and took them all back. 
10,10,40,DAWN,"But, what for? "
10,10,41,SHOP WORKER,It must be a manufacturing glitch. 
10,10,42,DAWN,That's just great. 
10,10,43,DAWN,I really wanted to have a Pokétch to wear for - my first Contest. - 
10,10,44,ASH,Don't let it bum you out!

10,10,58,JESSIE,The Twerps can tell time? Time out! You've gotta love this. 
10,10,59,JAMES,"They get a Pokétch, but we get the prize! "
10,10,60,MEOWTH,Who would've thought we'd get paid in Pikachu? 
10,10,61,DAWN,"Excuse me, is something wrong? "
10,10,62,JESSIE,No! Something's right! 
10,10,63,JAMES,"And for being so polite, take this with our compliments! "
10,10,64,DAWN,Really? That's great! Thank you so much! 
10,10,65,JESSIE,And we can't leave out the strapping young men!

10,10,71,DAWN,Right! I'll wear it all the time! 
10,10,72,DAWN,Wow! Dreams really do come true! I've just gotta win the Jubilife Contest now! 
10,10,73,SHINX,[WARNING] 
10,10,74,ASH,"Wow, what's that? "
10,10,75,POKEDEX,"Shinx. The Flash Pokémon. When it senses danger,the hairs on its body light up, and it runs away, leaving its opponent dazed. "
10,10,76,SHINX,[WARNING] 
10,10,77,DAWN,Uh oh. Why's that Shinx barking so much? 
10,10,78,LANDIS,It's that Pokétch! 
10,10,79,LANDIS,Shinx's trying to let you know that those Pokétches are all fakes! 
10,10,80,DAWN,All fakes? That can't be! 
10,10,81,LANDIS,"Afraid so! A real Pokétch wouldn't be such a dumb color, and soon the paint will be coming off! "
10,10,82,ASH,"Wow, are you sure? "
10,10,83,BROCK,He's sure. Maybe he's right! 
10,10,84,DAWN,Of course he's not right! How dare you rank on my Pokétch! 
10,10,85,LANDIS,All right. Guess I'll have to show you. 
10,10,86,DAWN,Give it back! What're you doing? 
10,10,87,DAWN,You ruined my Pokétch! 
10,10,88,LANDIS,See? Still think it's the real deal? 
10,10,89,ASH,These are fakes! 
10,10,90,DAWN,"Wait. But, how did you know? "
10,10,91,LANDIS,That's easy! Because my daddy would never make anything - so cheap! - 
10,10,92,ASH,Daddy? 
10,10,93,PIKACHU,[DISBELIEF] 
10,10,94,PRESIDENT,"Oh no, not again. First off, I want to thank you all for your interest in our Pokétches. And, furthermore... on behalf of the Pokétch Corporation I apologize for my son's actions. I'm sorry for all the trouble he caused! "
10,10,95,DAWN,No! The ones who made the fake Pokétches should apologize! 
10,10,96,ASH,Check it out. 
10,10,97,ASH,So this is where you make the real ones. 
10,10,98,PRESIDENT,"And as soon as I heard there were counterfeits in circulation, I had my distributors pull all my products from the stores! Unfortunately, we weren't in time to stop the television commercial ads... "
10,10,99,DAWN,But sir? Will you be selling them again in time for the Pokémon contest? 
10,10,100,PRESIDENT,"Truth is, until I get this imitation Pokétch problem solved, it's hard for me to say. "
10,10,101,DAWN,Oh. I see. 
10,10,102,LANDIS,"Excuse me, are you a Pokémon Coordinator? "
10,10,103,DAWN,Yeah! The Jubilife Contest will be my first one! 
10,10,104,LANDIS,"I see. We've got a rookie on our hands, do we? "
10,10,105,DAWN,"Well that may be true, but my combinations are all ready for the big time! "
10,10,106,PRESIDENT,I have something you might be interested in! Right here... This is a prototype. 
10,10,107,PRESIDENT,"It's our newest model! It actually measures a Pokémon's friendship, you see. "
10,10,108,DAWN,What? 
10,10,109,BROCK,That refers to the friendliness and good relations between a Pokémon and its trainer! 
10,10,110,DAWN,Wow! 
10,10,111,ASH,"Hey, would you mind testing Pikachu and me? "
10,10,112,PIKACHU,[AGREEING] 
10,10,113,PRESIDENT,Why not? Of course! - 
10,10,114,PRESIDENT,Shall we begin? - 
10,10,115,ASH,Sure! 
10,10,116,PRESIDENT,"Now, it appears you two get along well. But the question for now is: How well? "
10,10,117,PRESIDENT,Goodness gracious. You two are almost off the graph! 
10,10,118,LANDIS,Wow! That might be the highest reading I've ever seen! 
10,10,119,ASH,"Well, of course! That's because Pikachu and I've been best friends a long time! "
10,10,120,PIKACHU,[PROUD] 
10,10,121,BROCK,"If you don't mind, I'd like a sh*t! Croagunk, let's go! "
10,10,122,CROAGUNK,[GREETING] 
10,10,123,LANDIS,"So, how long has Croagunk been with you? "
10,10,124,BROCK,"Not long. Honestly, I just caught Croagunk! "
10,10,125,LANDIS,You did? 
10,10,126,PRESIDENT,"Well, let's go ahead anyway and have a look! "
10,10,127,PRESIDENT,I don't believe it! 
10,10,128,LANDIS,[CURIOUS] 
10,10,129,LANDIS,Daddy is something wrong? 
10,10,130,PRESIDENT,No no. I'm just amazed that's all! 
10,10,131,PRESIDENT,You two are extremely close! 
10,10,132,LANDIS,It's like you've been friends for years! 
10,10,133,CROAGUNK,[LOOKING] 
10,10,134,DAWN,"All right, now it's my turn! Go Piplup! "
10,10,135,PIPLUP,[EMERGING] 
10,10,136,PRESIDENT,Well! Such a spirited Pokémon you have here! - Shall we? - 
10,10,137,DAWN,We're all set! 
10,10,138,PIPLUP,[READY] 
10,10,139,DAWN,[SHOCKED] 
10,10,140,DAWN,The shame. 
10,10,141,PRESIDENT,No! Friendship has much to do with how long you and your Pokémon have been together. I'm sure it will go up before you know it! 
10,10,142,LANDIS,My advice? Don't enter that Contest no matter what you do! 
10,10,143,DAWN,Well if you're so smart... Why don't you test the friendship between you and your Shinx? 
10,10,144,LANDIS,"Uh, sorry. No can do. "
10,10,145,LANDIS,I'm too young! I'm still just a student at Trainers' School! 
10,10,146,DAWN,But what's a Trainers' school? You mean a school for young upcoming Trainers? 
10,10,147,LANDIS,"You can think when you want to! And just as soon as I graduate, me and Shinx are entering the Sinnoh League! "
10,10,148,ASH,"I guess you and I are gonna be rivals then! Yeah, you bet! Pikachu and I are going for the Sinnoh League too! "
10,10,149,LANDIS,"Wow, that's awesome! You must be real good! "
10,10,150,DAWN,"Well, you talk pretty wise for being just a little kid, but you're so scared to take a little test. "
10,10,151,LANDIS,"No way! If I was gonna measure our friendship, I'll bet you it'd be lots higher than you and your Piplup, for sure! "
10,10,152,PRESIDENT,"Officer Jenny has agreed to judge our contest this year, and I'm certain she'll do a wonderful job! "
10,10,153,DAWN,Great! 
10,10,154,LANDIS,"Good luck, Dawn! I hope you do really good! "
10,10,155,DAWN,Wow! Thanks a lot! 
10,10,156,LANDIS,You'll need all the luck you can get! 
10,10,157,DAWN,Little bratty smart-mouthed kid! 
10,10,158,DAWN,"I can hardly catch a Pokémon, but he's mister big-time expert! "
10,10,159,DAWN,"I'll show him! I'm gonna go out there, - and I'm gonna win first prize! - "
10,10,160,ASH,Yeah! That's it! 
10,10,161,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] / [CURIOUS] 
10,10,162,PIKACHU,[CONCERNED] 
10,10,163,ASH,"Pikachu, what? "
10,10,164,ASH,That's weird. What's with them? 
10,10,165,PRESIDENT,Strange. These things were a gift so there must be more than meets the eye. Oh my! What's this? 
10,10,166,PSYDUCK,[CHANTING] 
10,10,167,LANDIS,Hey! Whoa! Sounds like Psyduck! We just learned about it at Trainers' School! 
10,10,168,PRESIDENT,Psyduck? But why is it in the Pokétch? 
10,10,169,SHINX,[LISTENING] 
10,10,170,PRESIDENT,Listen. It sounds as if Psyduck is using an att*ck move! 
10,10,171,LANDIS,Really? Let' see. I'm thinking of Psyduck's moves. - 
10,10,172,LANDIS,"Hey, where'd Shinx go? - "
10,10,173,PRESIDENT,"What, son? "
10,10,174,PRESIDENT,That's not like Shinx to run off! 
10,10,175,ASH,Where are all of these Pokémon going anyway? 
10,10,176,DAWN,They're acting so weird! 
10,10,177,PIKACHU,[CALLING] 
10,10,178,DAWN,I don't think they hear us. 
10,10,179,BROCK,"Like they're being controlled, like robots! - "
10,10,180,PRESIDENT,Hey kids! - 
10,10,181,ASH,It's you! 
10,10,182,DAWN,Why are you out here? 
10,10,183,PRESIDENT,It's Shinx! Shinx just ran off for no reason! We've been looking everywhere we could! 
10,10,184,PRESIDENT,"Those fake Pokétches started playing the sound of a Psyduck calling some att*ck move, and then Shinx ran off! "
10,10,185,PRESIDENT,Shinx would never just leave. I was hoping perhaps you might've seen Shinx wandering with this Pokémon group! 
10,10,186,ASH,How did a Psyduck get in the Pokétches? 
10,10,187,PSYDUCK,[CHANTING] 
10,10,188,JESSIE,A technical triumph! 
10,10,189,JAMES,"Forget clunky robots, this rules! "
10,10,190,MEOWTH,Psyduck's got those Pokémon hypnotized and hapless! 
10,10,191,MEOWTH,"I'm telling you, if we keep on broadcasting, we're gonna revolutionize talk radio with this Poké-ploy! "

10,10,205,LANDIS,Why're they all in that box? 
10,10,206,PRESIDENT,And why are they just standing there? 
10,10,207,JAMES,It doesn't appear that Pikachu's mind has melted like the rest! 
10,10,208,JESSIE,And why did the Twerps tag along? 
10,10,209,MEOWTH,Their minds already melted! 
10,10,210,ASH,C'mon! You get outta there! 
10,10,211,DAWN,Your Trainers must be worrying themselves sick! 
10,10,212,BROCK,You've got to go back to them now! 
10,10,213,LANDIS,"Hey, look! There's Shinx! I was so worried about you! "
10,10,214,DAWN,Look out! -

10,10,220,DAWN,All right! Who's doing this? 
10,10,221,JESSIE,Listen! Is that a Twerp I hear? 
10,10,222,JAMES,It shrieks to me loud and clear! -

10,10,242,MEOWTH,"They got hypnotized, and we did the rest! "
10,10,243,PRESIDENT,But...that's not nice! 
10,10,244,DAWN,All right! You let those Pokémon go now!

10,09,59,DAWN,Check it out! - 
10,09,60,DAWN,"You see? It worked! You like it? I had just the worst pillow head when I woke up this morning, but Piplup and I sure fixed that! "
10,09,61,PIPLUP,[PROUD] 
10,09,62,BROCK,"Wow, I'm impressed! "
10,09,63,ASH,"Wow, what a weird way to use a Bubble Beam! "
10,09,64,DAWN,"And, it'll work on boys and girls, so let's put Bubble Beam to good use on your pillow head! "
10,09,65,ASH,"Hey, I'll be wearing a hat anyway. "

10,09,80,DAWN,Hey! It's a Buneary! 
10,09,81,DAWN'S POKEDEX,"Buneary. The Rabbit Pokémon. When sensing danger, it extends both ears as an alert, and when cold, it curls up and goes to sleep. "
10,09,82,BUNEARY,[CURIOUS] 
10,09,83,DAWN,"Wow that was awesome, the way you scooped up Pikachu like that! "
10,09,84,PIKACHU,[THANKFUL]

10,09,94,BROCK,She's still got a lot to learn. 
10,09,95,BROCK,"Dawn, here's the deal. You see, there are many Officer Jennies! See here? "
10,09,96,DAWN,Wow! Look at all of them. 
10,09,97,JENNY,"This was taken at the last countrywide festival, right? "
10,09,98,BROCK,I wish I could've been there! 
10,09,99,BROCK,"But now you're here! And I'm here too! The name's Brock, and my goal, other than be with you, is to become the greatest Pokémon breeder the world has ever known! "
10,09,100,JENNY,"And I'm Jenny from Jubilife City, and my sister is the Officer Jenny from Sandgem Town! "
10,09,101,DAWN,Your sister? You must be identical twins! 
10,09,102,BROCK,Of course they're not identical! Talk about rude! It's obvious the length of their hair and eyelashes is not the same! Aah. Not to mention that unique fragrance you're wearing... 
10,09,103,BROCK,"Of course, I could be wrong. "

10,09,106,JENNY,Your friend is strange. Have you ever seen these people? 
10,09,107,DAWN,I don't think so... 
10,09,108,JENNY,Last night some thieves broke into the factory just up ahead and stole a lot of machine parts. 
10,09,109,JENNY,This picture was taken by the factory's security surveillance camera! 
10,09,110,BROCK,Nope. They look weird to me. 
10,09,111,"ASH, JENNY, PIKACHU",[SURPRISED] 
10,09,112,DAWN,"Boy, that was quick! "
10,09,113,BROCK,Yup!

10,09,115,"ASH, BROCK, DAWN",Sure! 
10,09,116,PIKACHU,[HAPPY] 
10,09,117,ASH,"You know, I'd kinda like to catch that Buneary, too! "
10,09,118,DAWN,"But Ash, if we see that Buneary again, I want to catch it! "
10,09,119,ASH,"I know, but I still can't believe how far Buneary jumpedto save Pikachu! I've just gotta catch it! "
10,09,120,DAWN,"Come on Ash, remember I haven't even caught one Pokémon yet! "
10,09,121,BROCK,"Dawn, relax! "
10,09,122,BROCK,Remember you're just getting things started. 
10,09,123,DAWN,"Yeah, easy for you to say! We're going to be in Jubilife City tomorrow. The Pokémon Contest is coming up soon, and I need to catch some more Pokémon! "
10,09,124,JESSIE,Does that look good. 
10,09,125,MEOWTH,"Hey, you're preaching to the choir. "
10,09,126,JAMES,"Well, this choir is clean out of cold cash! Maybe hunger will make us hungrier to catch Pikachu! "
10,09,127,WOBBUFFET,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,09,128,MEOWTH,"Feeling like this, I couldn't catch a cold! "
10,09,129,JESSIE,And my inspiration's on hold. 
10,09,130,MEOWTH,Hey look! There's that creepy Croagunk! 
10,09,131,JESSIE,"With a face like that, you'd think it would hide. "
10,09,132,JAMES,"Teamed with the Twerps, it blends right in. "
10,09,133,WOBBUFFET,[LOOKING] 
10,09,134,DAWN,"What's wrong? Why don't you want to eat any more, Croagunk? "
10,09,135,ASH,Maybe Croagunk's got a little stomachache. 
10,09,136,BROCK,No way! Croagunk just likes to eat at its own pace.

10,09,164,DAWN,"Since I've had more than my share of goofs, I figure it's time for me to win one! No one's stopping me, and that includes you! "
10,09,165,ASH,"If that's how you feel, then go for it! "
10,09,166,DAWN,Then you'll have the honor of watching my first catch!

10,09,187,ASH,That was a move? - 
10,09,188,BROCK,"Yeah, Dizzy Punch. Your opponent becomes confused and dizzy, like that! "
10,09,189,DAWN,So now I just stand here and do nothing? 
10,09,190,BONSLY,[AGREEING] 
10,09,191,DAWN,What do I do? 
10,09,192,ASH,"First, just chill out! "

10,09,214,BROCK,Buneary's acting completely different than when battling with Piplup before... I wonder.

10,09,216,BUNEARY,[LOOKING] / [EMBARASSED]

10,04,209,NANDO,And so.good evening. 
10,04,210,ASH,What's he pondering.? 
10,04,211,NURSE JOY,Nando divides his interests equally between Gym Battles and Contests... 
10,04,212,NURSE JOY,.I think he's trying to decide between the two! 
10,04,213,ASH,Yeah? With a strong Budew like his he should always choose Gym battles! 
10,04,214,DAWN,No way! It's Contests! He sure knew how to show off his Budew! 
10,04,215,ASH,The Gym's the way! 
10,04,216,DAWN,He should choose Contests! - 
10,04,217,ASH,The Gyms! -

10,04,219,ASH,The Gyms! - 
10,04,220,DAWN,Contests! 
10,04,221,ASH,Maybe we should just let Nando decide for himself!

10,03,149,MEOWTH,You go tell that to the writers! 
10,03,150,WOBBUFFET,[ANGRY] 
10,03,151,"JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH",We're blasting off again! -

10,03,166,BROCK,Hi! I'm Brock! 
10,03,167,DAWN,"Hi, guys! My name is Dawn. And this is my partner, Piplup! "
10,03,168,PIPLUP,[GREETING] 
10,03,169,ASH,"So that's a Piplup, huh... "
10,03,170,POKEDEX,"Piplup. The Penguin Pokémon. It's very proud, and its thick down protects it from the cold. "
10,03,171,ASH,I sure hope your Piplup's okay after that. 
10,03,172,DAWN,"Thanks, but Piplup's fine! You tell him, Piplup! "
10,03,173,ASH,"Wow, you're a tough Pokémon! "
10,03,174,PIPLUP,[PROUD] / [WEAK] 
10,03,175,DAWN,"Piplup, no! "
10,03,176,BROCK,Obviously something's wrong big-time! I'll do everything I can to help. 
10,03,177,BROCK,It's important for any Trainer to always know the condition of their Pokémon! 
10,03,178,DAWN,"I'm sorry, Piplup! "
10,03,179,PIPLUP,[REASSURING] 
10,03,180,BROCK,"Now, let's have a look at Pikachu! "

10,03,186,"ASH, PAUL",From my mom? 
10,03,187,DAWN,"Wow, Brock, that's so cool you're a breeder! I know this has got to be the first time I've met a real Pokémon breeder ever! "
10,03,188,BROCK,"Really? Well, as soon as we get back to the lab, I'll make some special Pokémon food that's perfect for Water types! "
10,03,189,PIPLUP,[EXCITED] 
10,03,190,DAWN,"You're a lucky Pokémon, Piplup! - "
10,03,191,JENNY,I heard the news! -

10,03,200,DAWN,"Ash, what's wrong with Brock? "
10,03,201,ASH,"Nothing not for him, anyway "
10,03,202,PIKACHU,[RESIGNED] 
10,03,203,ASH,Wow! Check out the new clothes! 
10,03,204,PIKACHU,[EXCITED] 
10,03,205,BROCK,"She even put a new backpack in there, too! "
10,03,206,DELIA,I'm thrilled! Such a handsome young man 
10,03,207,ASH,"hat's really nice of you, Mom! "
10,03,208,DELIA,I wanted to give them to you while you were here. 
10,03,209,DELIA,ut you flew out of the house in such a rush! 
10,03,210,ASH,"orry about that,Mom. But everything's going just great here in the Sinnoh region, and I can't tell you how psyched I am! "
10,03,211,DELIA,"ell, I can see that! You did call Professor Oak and tell him Pikachu's safe, right? "
10,03,212,"ASH, PIKACHU",[SHOCKED] 
10,03,213,PROFESSOR OAK," appreciate you letting me know -the good news, young man!- "
10,03,214,ASH,And this is Dawn! She saved Pikachu. And this is Professor Oak. 
10,03,215,DAWN,"It's a real honor to meet you, sir! "
10,03,216,PROFESSOR OAK,"Well, it's a pleasure to meet you! A brand-new Trainer "
10,03,217,DAWN,"Right! I hope you don't mind. You love Pokémon poetry, don't you? - "
10,03,218,"ASH, BROCK",[SURPRISED] - 
10,03,219,PROFESSOR OAK,Yes! I do! 
10,03,220,DAWN,Awesome! Does that mean you know all the Pokémon poets? 
10,03,221,ASH,"You don't get it! He's a real professor, just like Professor Rowan! "
10,03,222,DAWN,But how come I always seem him on TV reading poems? 
10,03,223,ASH,How come? Well... 
10,03,224,PROF ROWAN,"Say, perhaps the good professor and I should have a little discussion "
10,03,225,PROF OAK,"ell, well! Professor! Say, Ash, may I speak with him for a moment? "
10,03,226,ASH,Sure! 
10,03,227,PROFESSOR ROWAN,"Perhaps you could spend a little less time reading Pokémon poetry on TV and more time doing your Pokémon research, eh, Samuel? "
10,03,228,PROFESSOR OAK,Right! I'll do that! 
10,03,229,BROCK,Those two must go way back! 
10,03,230,ASH,Guess so! 
10,03,231,DAWN,"So, what are you two doing here, anyway? "
10,03,232,ASH,"Well, I came here so I could compete in the Sinnoh League and win! "
10,03,233,BROCK,"Okay, it looks like the closest Gym to Sandgem Town is in Oreburgh City. Jubilife City's right on the way! "
10,03,234,DAWN,"That's awesome n I go, too? "
10,03,235,DAWN,I want to be the number one contest Coordinator! And the first contest I wanna compete in is in Jubilife City! 
10,03,236,ASH,"That's great! Come along! When it comes to traveling, the more the merrier, I say! - "
10,03,237,PIKACHU,[AGREEING] - 
10,03,238,ASH,"Brock, what do you think? "
10,03,239,BROCK,Of course! It'd be a lot of fun! 
10,03,240,"AIPOM, STARLY, PIPLUP",[HAPPY] 
10,03,241,ASH,It looks like everybody agrees! 
10,03,242,DAWN,And I'll get to spend some more time with Pikachu! 
10,03,243,PIKACHU,[AGREEING] 
10,03,244,ASH,"Okay, we're all set. Let's go! "
10,03,245,DAWN,"Hold on. Aren't you going to put Pikachu in a Poké Ball, too? "
10,03,246,ASH,Nah. Pikachu hates traveling that way when my shoulder's much more fun! 
10,03,247,PIKACHU,[AGREEING] 
10,03,248,DAWN,"Wow, that's amazing! "
10,03,249,PIKACHU,[HAPPY] 
10,03,250,PROFESSOR ROWAN,You'll learn that there are as many different Pokémon personalities as there are Pokémon! 
10,03,251,ASH,"We've gotta get going now, but thanks for everything you've done for us, Professor! "
10,03,252,PROFESSOR ROWAN,Of course! 
10,03,253,PROFESSOR ROWAN,Yes? Who are you? 
10,03,254,PAUL,"The name's Paul. And from the looks of things, you must be Professor Rowan... - "
10,03,255,PAUL,I'm waiting for him! - 
10,03,256,ASH,For me? 
10,03,257,PAUL,You've got three Pokémon now. Wanna battle? 
10,03,258,PIKACHU,[NERVOUS] 
10,03,259,ASH,Sure! I'm ready! I'm gonna be a Pokémon Master and the way to do that is to b*at challengers like you! 
10,03,260,PIKACHU,[FOCUSED] 
10,03,261,PROFESSOR ROWAN,Then off to my back garden! - 
10,03,262,BROCK,I'll be the referee. - 
10,03,263,DAWN,This is great! I've never seen a real Pokémon battle before. 
10,03,264,ASH,"Well, you're seeing one now! So hold on to your hat! "
10,03,265,ASH,"What's so funny, Paul? "
10,03,266,PAUL,Just that you talk like such a little kid. 
10,03,267,ASH,Oh yeah? 
10,03,268,PAUL,"Yeah! Okay, like I said before, this is gonna be a three-on-three battle with no substitutions, and the one with two wins first is the winner. Got it? "
10,03,269,ASH,I got it! Starly! I choose you! 
10,03,270,ASH'S STARLY,[APPEARING] 
10,03,271,PAUL,"Now, Starly, stand by. I choose you! "
10,03,272,PAUL'S STARLY,[APPEARING]

10,03,274,PAUL,"Okay, Ash, I'll let you go first! "
10,03,275,ASH,"Right! Starly, use Quick att*ck! "
10,03,276,ASH'S STARLY,[QUICK att*ck MOVE] 
10,03,277,PAUL'S STARLY,[HIT] 
10,03,278,DAWN,It's a hit! 
10,03,279,PROFESSOR ROWAN,"True, but it doesn't look like it did much damage. "
10,03,280,PROFESSOR ROWAN,I think Paul is just testing Ash's Starly's att*ck power! 
10,03,281,PAUL,"Starly, Aerial Ace! "
10,03,282,PAUL'S STARLY,[AERIAL ACE MOVE] 
10,03,283,ASH'S STARLY,[IMPACT]

10,03,290,PAUL'S STARLY,[FOCUSED] 
10,03,291,ASH,The real one's in the back! Dodge it now! 
10,03,292,PAUL,Aerial Ace! 
10,03,293,ASH'S STARLY,[IMPACT] 
10,03,294,ASH'S STARLY,[STUNNED] 
10,03,295,BROCK,Ash's Starly is unable to battle! Paul's Starly is the winner! 
10,03,296,ASH,"Starly, return, now! You were great, Starly! "
10,03,297,PAUL,"I think I figured out your battle style. You cover up your weak att*cks by pushing. And when you combine that with a lame-o strategy like yours, I can't help but feel sorry for any Pokémon who gets stuck with a lousy Trainer like you! "
10,03,298,PAUL,That's all you've got?! 
10,03,299,ASH,"Now, Aipom! You're up next! "
10,03,300,AIPOM,[APPEARING]

10,03,312,PAUL,Use Flame Wheel! 
10,03,313,CHIMCHAR,[FLAME WHEEL MOVE] 
10,03,314,AIPOM,[IMPACT] 
10,03,315,DAWN,That Focus Punch disappeared! 
10,03,316,PROFESSOR ROWAN,"Yes. If a Pokémon is using Focus Punch and gets att*cked before it's complete, the att*ck can't be finished! "
10,03,317,PAUL,"Not a good choice of att*cks, Ash. Chimchar, go! "
10,03,318,CHIMCHAR,[FOCUSED] 
10,03,319,ASH,"Double Team, Aipom! "

10,03,326,ASH,"Focus Punch again, Aipom! "
10,03,327,AIPOM,[FOCUS PUNCH MOVE] 
10,03,328,PAUL,"Chimchar, use Flame Wheel! "
10,03,329,CHIMCHAR,[FLAME WHEEL MOVE] 
10,03,330,ASH,Just wait that's it. - 
10,03,331,PAUL,What's he up to? - 
10,03,332,ASH,"Now, jump and then dodge! "
10,03,333,ASH,HIT IT! 
10,03,334,AIPOM,[EFFORT] 
10,03,335,CHIMCHAR,[IMPACT] 
10,03,336,AIPOM,[PROUD] 
10,03,337,CHIMCHAR,[STUNNED] 
10,03,338,BROCK,Chimchar's unable to battle! Aipom's the winner! - 
10,03,339,DAWN,All right! - 
10,03,340,PAUL,"Okay, Chimchar, return! "
10,03,341,PAUL,You're still just as useless as can be! 
10,03,342,"ASH, , PAUL","Aipom, return! You were awesome! It looks like it's one-on-one! "
10,03,343,ASH,Pikachuit's you and me. Ready?

10,03,348,DAWN,Elekid! How cool! 
10,03,349,DAWN'S POKEDEX,Elekid. The Electric Pokémon. Elekid waves its arms to produce a strong electrical charge and gains strength when lightning is present. 
10,03,350,PAUL,Is Pikachu the one who does Volt Tackle? - 
10,03,351,ASH,Yeah. So what? - 
10,03,352,PAUL,Sonothing! 
10,03,353,ASH,"All right, Pikachu, use Thunderbolt! "
10,03,354,PIKACHU,[THUNDERBOLT MOVE] 
10,03,355,ELEKID,[CALM] 
10,03,356,DAWN,It doesn't look like it did a thing! 
10,03,357,PROFESSOR ROWAN,"True. Electric-type Pokémon don't sustain much if any damage when att*cked by a - move of the same type, my dear - "
10,03,358,PAUL,"Thunder, go! "
10,03,359,ELEKID,[THUNDER MOVE] 
10,03,360,PIKACHU,[PAINED]

10,03,362,PIKACHU,[STRUGGLING] 
10,03,363,ASH,Pikachu! Are you okay? 
10,03,364,PIKACHU,[AFFIRMATIVE] 
10,03,365,PAUL,"Of course, there's a reason I let you go first. "
10,03,366,ASH,What? 
10,03,367,PIKACHU,[ANNOYED] 
10,03,368,PAUL,Because I'm smart! Elekid and I used the energy from yourPikachu's Thunderbolt to supercharge our Thunder! 
10,03,369,ASH,We'll see how smart you are! Volt Tackle! 
10,03,370,PIKACHU,[VOLT TACKLE MOVE] 
10,03,371,PAUL,"Elekid, Protect! "
10,03,372,ELEKID,[PROTECT MOVE] 
10,03,373,PIKACHU,[SHOCKED] 
10,03,374,PIKACHU,[IMPACT] 
10,03,375,DAWN,How did that happen? 
10,03,376,PROFESSOR ROWAN,"Well, Volt Tackle can cause damage to the one being att*cked and the one attacking. And by using protect to avoid all its damage that was very clever! "
10,03,377,PAUL,Are we done yet? 
10,03,378,ELEKID,[SMUG] 
10,03,379,PIKACHU,[STRUGGLING] 
10,03,380,ASH,"Pikachu, how do you feel? "
10,03,381,PIKACHU,[DETERMINED]

10,03,390,PAUL,"Thunder Punch, NOW! "
10,03,391,ASH,Not so fastIron Tail's still on the way! 
10,03,392,ELEKID,[FOCUSED] 
10,03,393,PIKACHU,[IRON TAIL MOVE] 
10,03,394,ELEKID,[IMPACT]

10,03,403,BROCK,We have a tie! Both sides are unable to battle! 
10,03,404,DAWN,Wow... Guess that means they're equally strong! 
10,03,405,PAUL,"All right, Elekid, return! "
10,03,406,ASH,Pikachu... 
10,03,407,BROCK,That sure looked like a draw to me. 
10,03,408,ASH,"Well, not me. Pikachu was the first to go down. We lost. Isn't that right? "
10,03,409,PAUL,It was called as a tie. A tie it is. 
10,03,410,STARLY,[RELIEVED] 
10,03,411,ASH,What'd you do that for? 
10,03,412,PAUL,There's a million Starly as strong as that one. 
10,03,413,PAUL,"Soon as I run across a stronger one, I'll just grab it! "
10,03,414,ASH,You'll just what?! 
10,03,415,PAUL,Professor! Thanks for the use of the field. I appreciate it.
